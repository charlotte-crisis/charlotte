<<set $canGoToBed = false>>

You got as much sleep as you could manage. Your bed draws you back in, but you withstand its pull.
You remember that you signed up for the school's Art Club sessions.
Prepare your look in the CLOSET, check your Stats at the DESK, and off you go!

    You just got back!
<<else>>
    You're headed out to art club.
    Your sister's words weight heavily on you.
    You don't know if you should go out as Charlotte or Charles now.
    Are you ready to head out?

    -> No (Go back)

    -> Yes (Go to school) #continue

Try as you might, you cannot forget what Sister sent.
You knew this conflict was gonna come at some point, but not this soon...
Regardless, you're back in your room, protected from everything outside. For now.
In it, there are two most familiar things; your CLOSET and your BED.
You should probably go to BED first.
And when you wake up, you'll prepare your look in the CLOSET.
This is what you do every day, but with Sister's text today, you feel like everything is about to change...

    // start the next scene
    <<goto_black_room()>>
    Like all people your age, you check your phone in bed.
    Sister just updated her status...
    SISTER: "Ugh. Why can't Mother give me a break."
    You wonder if it's just her usual complaining, or if it's to do with you.
    You toss and turn a bit before going to sleep.

You feel like hanging out with a friend this week, for a quick meal.
Who will you ask out?
-> Anthony <<if getRelationship("A") >= 30>>
    You call Anthony up for a hangout.
    <<goto_room_hangout_a()>>

-> Nadia <<if getRelationship("N") >= 30>>
    You call Nadia up for a hangout.
    <<goto_room_hangout_n()>>

-> Vera <<if getRelationship("V") >= 30>>
    You call Vera up for a hangout.
    <<goto_room_hangout_v()>>

-> On second thought, nevermind.
    Hmm… you don't seem to be friendly enough with anyone.
    You can stay in today, but please try to understand and befriend people around you…
