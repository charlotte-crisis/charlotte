You're a little early to the session today, and so are Anthony and Vera.
They are sitting apart from each other. Seems like last session wasn't enough to bring them together.
Behind his laptop, Anthony buries his head in whatever he's drawing, occasionally looking up at his screen.
Vera is scrolling through her phone casually.
Go talk to them before the session starts!

Nadia and Eleanor enter the room together.
Eleanor: "Oh, you guys are here already!"
Nadia: "Guess we didn't need to rush."
Eleanor: "Alright! But... this is all we have?"
Vera: "Seems like it."
Eleanor: "Ah... I was expecting a few more people. This could have been a group activity."
Anthony: "What do you want us to do?"
Eleanor: "We're designing a T-shirt for the Art Club!"
Anthony: "Really? Only the 4 of us show up regularly and you still want a T-shirt?"

-> "Yeah, I'm not sure this is a good idea." //(+5% Anthony relationship)
    <<changeRelationship("A", 5)>>
    Eleanor slumps her shoulders a bit. She struggles to keep her face unchanged.
    Then, she shrugs.
    Eleanor: "Fine, hypothetically, we could make a T-shirt."
    Eleanor: "Those who are against the idea of a shirt, maybe... treat this as just any other graphic design exercise?"
    Nadia: "Sounds good to me."

-> "This could be the start of something new."
    Anthony: "What do you mean?"
    <<addExperience(10)>>
    You: "I mean, we've got to believe in ourselves because no one else will, right?" (+10 XP)
    You: "So maybe if we've got a cool shirt, people will ask who we are, and more people will be interested to join."
    Eleanor: "That's a great way to see it! Thanks, {$name}."

Eleanor: "Alright then, let's design for about 30 minutes and we can share."
<<goto_room_cca_1_seated()>>
You scour the Internet for ideas, eventually settling between three choices.

-> A paint blob with "Art Club" in the middle.
    <<set $logo = "blob">>
    Avant-garde, yet simple.
    You try not to think about how exactly you want to draw the blob, and put it to paper.

-> A palette and paintbrush.
    <<set $logo = "palette">>
    People will definitely associate this one with "art".
    You quickly sketch out the silhouette and touch up its various details.

-> A sunset.
    <<set $logo = "sunset">>
    You didn't need the Internet for this one.
    Sunsets have always held this allure for you. You love to appreciate their beauty at the end of a long day.
    And isn't that what art is about? Not just the final product, but the journey there.

You: "Alright, here goes..."

    Anthony: "Uh... what am I looking at?"
    Vera: "Looks like a puddle."
    Nadia: "No, I think it's a blob of paint."
    You: "That's right."
    Eleanor: "If anything, it looks like the Nickelodeon logo. I think it's workable, but let's see if there's anything else?"
<<elseif $logo == "palette">>
    Nadia: "Okay, this one really says 'Art Club'. Very direct."
    Anthony: "Reminds me of Microsoft Paint."
    Vera: "We don't just do painting, though, right?"
    Eleanor: "Nadia has a point. An easily identifiable logo would be good on a T-shirt. Moving on..."

    Vera: "Looks like I'm not the only one with a weather feature for a logo."
    Nadia: "What do you mean?"

Anthony: "Yep."

Nadia: "Okay, my turn!"
She shows a design of two students drawing each other while smiling.
Eleanor: "Wah, this one is good. Even if it's just a sketch for now."
Vera: "Yeah, you can always add the details later."
Anthony: "Anime again."

Vera turns her paper around. It's a butterfly with rainbow coloured wings.
Nadia: "Rainbows again? That's becoming your trademark already!"
Vera: "Yep. Rainbows are colourful! They can mean many things, like diversity, creativity, acceptance..."
Anthony gives an exasperated sigh.
Eleanor: "What's wrong, Anthony?"

Vera: "Why?"

    Anthony: "I'll spread it among my friends. We're all losers, but we can all laugh at him."
-> "What the fuck, Anthony?"
    Anthony: "What? Don't tell me you also cannot handle the truth."
    You: "No, this just isn't right."
    Anthony: "Sure, tell me why."
    -> "Don't people have the right to secrets anymore?"
        Anthony: "So you're telling me he's not proud to be an ah gua?"
        You: "If she doesn't want to bring attention to it, that is her right."
        Anthony: "So he's ashamed of what he does."
        You: "You know what? You're impossible to deal with. I'm done here."

            Anthony stays silent.
            You: "You don't dare to."
            Anthony: "It's not worth my time. Maybe he will start crying."
            You: "You're just making excuses. All you dare to do is talk shit behind her back."

            Anthony walks off. (-5% Anthony relationship)

            Well done. You've exposed him for the coward he is. (+5% confidence)

            Anthony: "Maybe I will, huh? He would look so pathetic, crying on the floor."
            What did you just hear...

Nadia: "I guess so... let's hope that T-shirt design works."
-> "Who knows?"
    Nadia: "I really don't want the club to shut down. It's a great place to make friends."
    You: "Yeah, we can only hope."

-> "Your idea might just save us all."
    Nadia: "What do you mean?"
    You: "Your design. It's cute, it appeals to a lot of people, and we can all tell you put effort into it."
    Nadia smiles a bit.

Vera: "Hey, {$name}."
You: "Hey, Vera! What's up?"
Vera: "Same stuff. Just scrolling through Pinterest. And Instagram. And TikTok."
-> "For art ideas?"
    Vera: "Haha, I'd be a much better student if I was that dedicated, right?"
    Vera: "Only about 1% of what I'm seeing is vibes. The rest of it is fashion and trans politics."
-> "Wow, that's a lot of social media."
    Vera: "Haha, I'd be a much better student if I could get rid of a few of those, right?"
    Vera: "I think it still helps me, though."
    You: "How so?"
    Vera: "I learn from trans content, at least."
