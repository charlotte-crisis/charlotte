Vera: "Hey Charlotte."
You: "Hi Vera. How's it going?"
Vera: "It's going."
Vera: "Heh. Really though, it's nice to sit down and talk like this."
Vera: "So, I guess you came here with a purpose other than just coffee, right?"
You: "Yeah, kinda. I wanted to ask you some questions."
Vera: "Shoot."

Vera: "Heh. Where do I even begin?"
Vera: "I think the most important thing is, just treat us as normal human beings."
Vera: "We're people with hopes and dreams like yourselves."

-> "When did you know you were trans?"
    Vera: "Hmm, very early on."
    Vera: "It's a classic trans story."
    Vera: "In elementary school, I felt... different from the boys."
    You: "Elementary school?"
    Vera: "I'm not from here, remember?"
    Vera: "Wow, I can't imagine having to go through National Service."
    Vera: "Anyway, I grew out my hair in middle school."
    Vera: "By the time I came here, I was already presenting femme enough to pass."
    Vera: "Thankfully my school back then allowed me to present how I wanted."
    -> "Hmm, my story is different..."
        Vera: "How so?"
        You: "I never really thought about Charlotte until university."
        You: "I didn't have that eureka moment in primary school..."
        You: "So am I... you know, like you?"
        Vera: "Well, everyone takes a different path through this."
        Vera: "Your path is totally valid, Charlotte."
    
    -> "You're so brave."
        Vera: "Heh, thanks."
        Vera: "That's a cliche 'straight-to-queer' thing to say, but..."
        Vera: "I'll accept it, because I know you mean it."
        Vera: "And you're brave too. Aren't we all?"
        Vera: "Just don't put me on a pedestal. I'm not a hero."
    
    -> "Did you ever get bullied for it?"
        Vera: "Hmm... thankfully, not really?"
        Vera: "When I was a kid, I already didn't like to hang out with the boys."
        Vera: "There's just something about... aggression, masculinity, competition..."
        Vera: "It's so off-putting, don't you think?"
        You: "Absolutely."
        Vera: "I mean, not to say those feelings are totally disgusting."
        Vera: "But that life, it just wasn't for me."
        Vera: "And when that happens, you befriend kinder people."
        Vera: "So thankfully I already had a good grasp of myself and the people around me..."
        Vera: "Which isn't something other folks might have."

-> "I heard you need to like, medicate, or something?"
    Vera: "Sure I do."
    Vera: "You might see me consume my estrogen medication sometimes."
    Vera: "But that's simply healthcare."
    Vera: "I mean, no one judges you for taking Panadol if you have a fever, right?"
    You: "Yeah, I guess..."
    Vera: "So it's the same. Except the medication is supposed to fix dysphoria."

    -> "Isn't it painful?"
        Vera: "Being trapped in a male body is more painful."
        Vera: "I mean, you probably know a thing or two about that."
        -> "Uh, not really..."
            Vera: "Oh?"
            You: "Yeah. I'm fine with being a guy."
            Vera: "Hmm. Not even a bit of discomfort?"
            You: "Not really... I've lived as a guy for 25 years."
            You: "Why stop?"
            Vera: "That's so egg of you."
            Vera: "I mean, why not just start HRT if you're already dressing so femininely?"
            -> "Uh, isn't that a little sudden..."
                Vera: "What do you mean?"
                Vera: "You're already quite far down the rabbit hole."
                Vera: "You can finish this and be the girl you always wanted to be."
                You: "I'm not sure..."
                Vera: "You will be. Some day."

                You: "Vera. Please. I'm not you."
                You: "I appreciate your help, but... this is my fight."
                You: "If I don't feel comfortable with hormones, please don't pressure me into them."
                Vera: "But..."
                You: "Vera, just stop. I'm scared of this."
                Vera sighs.
                Vera: "Sorry. I went a little too far there."
                Vera: "I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable..."
                Vera: "HRT seemed like such a natural option to me when I started."
                Vera: "But I know it's not so for you... and I will remember that."
                Vera: "Anyway, I also want you to know that you're valid and I support you."

                Vera: "You'd be a lot happier if you did. I know I was."

            Vera: "I mean, what would I know, I don't want to reverse my transition."
            Vera: "But maybe you would."
            Vera: "Either way, don't ever try to start this on your own."
            Vera: "Or even with me. I'm not studying for a doctorate in medicine."
            You: "Yeah, I'll find someone qualified."
            Vera: "Mhmm. Charlotte... really..."
            Vera: "This is a difficult journey. From one girl to another..."
            Vera: "I wish you the best."

    -> "Isn't it expensive?"
        Vera: "Yeah, it is..."

            Vera: "Just know that I get my medication, and you probably shouldn't use my way."

                    Vera slams her palm on the table.

                    Vera: "If you can't respect my boundary on this, I'm sorry, we can't talk."
                    Vera walks off.

            Vera: "What, did you think I was going to say sex work was the sus thing?"
            Vera: "It isn't. They deserve our respect."
            Vera: "And sometimes that's all trans people can do..."
            Vera: "That should never be the case."

        Vera: "Still, please prioritise your own healthcare over money."
        Vera: "Money can be earned... but you've only got one body."
        Vera: "I know that's something boomers would say..."
        Vera: "But I'm re-appropriating it."
        Vera: "Trans healthcare is the same as any other form of healthcare."

Vera: "School is schooling, I guess."
Vera: "I'm passionate about what I study, but..."
Vera: "Sometimes my views clash with the prof's."
Vera: "Some profs have been here long enough for you to feel their age."
Vera: "And it's really annoying when they think they know it all, but..."
Vera: "Well, you play games, right? So you'll probably get this reference, even if I don't."
Vera: "Profs are kind of like level 100 players and we're the level 1 players."
Vera: "They're teaching us how to get to level 100, but..."
Vera: "Who said that was the highest level possible?"

# (if Vera doesn't know about Charlotte) --> TODO: Need a check for this
You very briefly tell Vera that you're a crossdresser.
Vera: "Well, I guess all queer people need to cross that bridge. Tell me more."
You: "My mother hates Charlotte. And I need options."
Vera: "Hmm... I hate to say this, but..."
Vera: "You do know that I'm also not on good terms with my parents, right?"
Vera: "They're so far from here that there's nothing they can do about it."
Vera: "Unfortunately, the threat is closer to your shores."
Vera: "So... what do you want to do?"

-> "I want to heal."
    Vera: "Huh. That's... gonna be hard."
    Vera: "Like, what do you even mean by that?"
    -> "I'm sorry. That just sounded like something badass to say."
        Vera: "Heh. That's the stuff of movies."
        Vera: "But your life isn't one."
        Vera: "So you gotta get your head out of the clouds, girl."

    -> "I don't want to hurt my mother."
        Vera: "Uh... you do realise that's next to impossible, right?"
        Vera: "Especially if she's a boomer."
        Vera: "Hate to say it, but it's quite hard to change their mindset."
        Vera: "It's either you, or her."

        -> "We can compromise."
            Vera: "On what?"
            Vera: "Your right to exist the way you want to?"
            Vera: "She wants Charlotte gone, doesn't she?"
            Vera: "There's no negotiating with her."

                Vera: "Oh, we're talking numbers now, are we?"
                Vera: "My parents wanted me to be Vera 0% of the time."
                Vera: "So don't be surprised if your parents want that too."
            
            -> "She knows I'm her retirement plan."
                Vera: "So your relationship with her is purely monetary."
                Vera: "And she acknowledges that she's got limited time left."

            Vera: "And besides, we came to university and lived away from our parents for a reason."
            Vera: "To be independent of them."

            -> "She's taken care of me since I was young."
                Vera: "That was her obligation as a parent."
                Vera: "It isn't something she can hold over your head as a threat."
            
            -> "I can't fight my own mother."
                Vera: "Well, you're not killing or injuring her."
                Vera: "But below that, I'd say anything else is fair game."
                Vera: "You have to make yourself heard, Charlotte."
            
            Vera: "Even if she wants the best for you..."
            Vera: "Isn't that something you need to achieve for yourself?"

                Vera: "I know you might be close to her."

            You: "It's okay, Vera. No need to keep saying sorry."
            You: "What are you, Canadian?"
            Vera laughs. # (+5% Vera relationship)
            Vera: "Who knows, I might move there."
        <<endif>>

        Vera: "Well, either way, it might be best to not involve your dad at all."
        Vera: "One aggravated parent is already enough..."

    -> "The one that minimises damage."
        Vera: "What? That's not possible."
        Vera: "I know it's not right to stereotype the older generation..."
        Vera: "But it seems you and I both got the strictest kind of parents."
        Vera: "Minimising damage means hiding and repressing Charlotte."
        Vera: "Does that sound like a long-term solution to you?"

        -> "Yes."
            Vera: "No it isn't!"
            Vera: "Even if you hide carefully and diligently, at some point..."
            Vera: "You're gonna slip up."
            Vera: "For me it was when my mother found my medication."
            Vera: "And for you, it might be your mother finding your dresses."

            -> "You're right."
                You: "I should be ready for damage."
                Vera: "Unfortunately, yes."
                Vera: "We can only hope that the damage is worth it..."
                Vera: "Sometimes, it isn't. But most times we can learn from it."
                Vera: "Even if the lesson is 'don't trust the boomers'."
            
            -> "I will be even more conscientious."
                Vera: "Then you're gonna repress and hide until you can't take it anymore?"
                Vera: "That level of repression rarely ends well, Charlotte."
                Vera: "Please, just take my word for it and face this problem head-on."
        
        -> "No."
            Vera: "Exactly."
            Vera: "I know it's gonna be tough."
            Vera: "But this conflict is inevitable..."
            Vera: "Hell, I'm probably not even in its most advanced stages yet."

            -> "We'll get through it together."
                You: "Even though we're on different paths..."
                You: "I appreciate the help and support."
                Vera: "Aww, thanks, Charlotte."
        
            -> "That sounds scary."
                Vera: "It is. This journey was never meant to be easy."
                Vera: "But for people like us, the light at the end of the tunnel is what makes it worth it."

    Vera: "Well, either way, this is the biggest decision you'll make in your life."
    Vera: "And I just wanted to say..."
    Vera: "I am so proud of you for standing up for yourself."
    Vera: "Just don't leave any bodies in your wake."

-> "I want to give in."
    Vera: "Am I hearing you right?"
    Vera: "You'd give up Charlotte just to appease your mother?"

    -> "I'm also tired of being a woman."
        Vera: "Is it the makeup and dresses?"
        Vera: "I know, it's very hard to get ready every morning..."
        Vera: "But don't you think it's worth it to see Charlotte as her best self?"

        -> "It's the stress of living a double life."
            You: "I mean, I have to present male at home."
            You: "So why bother, right?"
            Vera: "Heh. This is where I'd suggest you start HRT..."
            Vera: "But maybe I shouldn't."
            Vera: "That would be solving one problem with what could be a bigger problem."
    
        ->  "Maybe Charlotte was just a phase."
            Vera: "Be very careful of where you're going with that phrase."
            Vera: "Don't say that in front of other trans people."
            Vera: "You wouldn't want to say that their transition is a phase..."
            Vera: "And if you say that about me, you're done."
            
        -> "Nah, I'm done."
            You: "I feel like I'm on a trial version of femininity."
            You: "And it's expiring soon."
            You: "I'm ready to go back to my male life now."
            Vera: "Hmm. That's not something I thought I'd hear."
            Vera: "I hope it's really you speaking, then."
            Vera: "Not any external forces pressuring you to give up Charlotte..."
            Vera: "But a decision made with Charlotte's consent too."

    -> "I prioritise my mother."
        Vera: "Heh. Well, it's your choice."
        Vera: "I personally could never do that."
        Vera: "To be saccharinely sweet to your mother..."
        Vera: "To the extent where you'd give up who you are to get there..."
        Vera: "Ugh. Not my thing."
    
    Vera: "Still... you had a good thing going on, Charlotte."
    Vera: "Regardless of your reasons, I hope you don't do something you regret."
    Vera: "And, please, remember this vibrant period of self-expression."
    Vera: "It's probably the happiest part of your life. So far."

-> "Actually, I just want to hide."
    Vera: "Heh. That's kind of what I'm doing, too."
    Vera: "My parents are entire time zones away."
    Vera: "But, yours are only MRT stations away..."
    Vera: "And before long, you'll be staying with them again."
    Vera: "So how do you think you can hide?"

    -> "Plastic box under the bed."
        Vera: "What?"
        Vera: "Oh, you mean like, literally hiding everything in a box."
        Vera: "Well, that's one way to do it, but..."
        Vera: "Wouldn't it be hard to access your stuff?"
        Vera: "And besides, this isn't really a long-term solution, isn't it?"
        Vera: "You're still under your parents' control."
        Vera: "Charlotte would still have to live with them."
        
    -> "Rent my own place."
        Vera: "Oh, that'd be nice."
        Vera: "But I hear rentals here are super high..."
        Vera: "I mean, I'm not one to ask for budgeting advice."
        Vera: "Still, I'm sure there are other reasons you'd want to have your own place."
        Vera: "We're in our twenties, gonna graduate from university..."
        Vera: "Yet we're still dependent on our parents?"
        You: "Doesn't sit well with me, yeah."
        
    -> "Move overseas."
        Vera: "Yass! Love that for you."
        Vera: "I mean, if I could travel anywhere in the world, it would be back to California."
        Vera: "That was really peak Vera."
        Vera: "But, you know, I've been moving around since I was little."
        Vera: "Countries, allegiances, all that doesn't matter to me unless citizenship gives benefits."
        Vera: "But, as far as I know, you're not that type of person, right?"

        -> "Yeah, I'll miss this place."
            You: "It's not perfect, but I've invested too much of my life here to just up and leave."
            Vera: "Ah. That's... a pity."

        -> "Nope. Screw this place."
            You: "So many of us are moving overseas after all."
            You: "What's one more person?"
            You: "Besides, I know this society will never be happy with Charlotte."

    Vera: "Well, either way, it would be good to travel the world first."
    Vera: "Get a sense of what life's like in other countries and then decide."
    Vera: "Which ultimately comes back to money, doesn't it..."
