Vera: "Hey Charlotte."
You: "Hi Vera. How's it going?"
Vera: "It's going."
Vera: "Heh. Really though, it's nice to sit down and talk like this."
Vera: "So, I guess you came here with a purpose other than just coffee, right?"
You: "Yeah, kinda. I wanted to ask you some questions."
Vera: "Shoot."

Vera: "School is schooling, I guess."
Vera: "I'm passionate about what I study, but..."
Vera: "Sometimes my views clash with the prof's."
-> "Oh, how so?"
    Vera: "Some profs have been here long enough for you to feel their age."
    Vera: "And it's really annoying when they think they know it all, but..."
    Vera: "You know what, never mind. Things can get political real fast when I talk about this."

-> "You're saying you're... smarter than the prof?"
    Vera: "Hey, don't give me that look. It's not like they know everything either."
    Vera: "Theory is a useful framework but lived experience is ultimately more important."
    Vera: "So I defer to the prof's experience, but ultimately my opinions are my own."

Vera: "Well, you play games, right? So you'll probably get this reference, even if I don't."
Vera: "Profs are kind of like level 100 players and we're the level 1 players."
Vera: "They're teaching us how to get to level 100, but they are still players after all, right?"
Vera: "Anyway, that was just a sidetrack. What about you?"

# (if Vera doesn't know about Charlotte) --> TODO: Need a check for this
You very briefly tell Vera that you're a crossdresser.
Vera: "Well, I guess all queer people need to cross that bridge. Tell me more."
You: "My mother hates Charlotte. And I need options."
Vera: "Hmm... I hate to say this, but..."
Vera: "You do know that I'm also not on good terms with my parents, right?"
Vera: "They're so far from here that there's nothing they can do about it."
Vera: "Unfortunately, the threat is closer to your shores."
Vera: "So... what do you want to do?"

-> "I want to heal."
    Vera: "Huh. That's... gonna be hard."
    Vera: "Like, what do you even mean by that?"
    -> "I'm sorry. That just sounded like something badass to say."
        Vera: "Heh. That's the stuff of movies."
        Vera: "But your life isn't one."
        Vera: "So you gotta get your head out of the clouds, girl."

    -> "I don't want to hurt my mother."
        Vera: "Uh... you do realise that's next to impossible, right?"
        Vera: "Especially if she's a boomer."
        Vera: "Hate to say it, but it's quite hard to change their mindset."
        Vera: "It's either you, or her."

        -> "We can compromise."
            Vera: "On what?"
            Vera: "Your right to exist the way you want to?"
            Vera: "She wants Charlotte gone, doesn't she?"
            Vera: "There's no negotiating with her."
            
            -> "I'm only Charlotte 10% of the time..."
                You: "I can present as male 90% of the time."
                You: "She doesn't need to know about the 10%."
                Vera: "Oh, we're talking numbers now, are we?"
                Vera: "My parents wanted me to be Vera 0% of the time."
                Vera: "So don't be surprised if your parents want that too."
            
            -> "She knows I'm her retirement plan."
                Vera: "So your relationship with her is purely monetary."
                Vera: "And she acknowledges that she's got limited time left."
                Vera: "So, if the both of you really think that..."
                Vera: "Isn't Charlotte just in jail with an undetermined release date?"
            
            Vera: "Well, I'm not sure what you want to compromise on."
            Vera: "But I wish you the best of luck."
        
        -> "I know she wants the best for me."
            Vera: "Is a life without Charlotte really the best for you?"
            Vera: "And besides, we came to university and lived away from our parents for a reason."
            Vera: "To be independent of them."

            -> "She's taken care of me since I was young."
                Vera: "That was her obligation as a parent."
                Vera: "It isn't something she can hold over your head as a threat."
            
            -> "I can't fight my own mother."
                Vera: "Well, you're not killing or injuring her."
                Vera: "But below that, I'd say anything else is fair game."
                Vera: "You have to make yourself heard, Charlotte."
            
            Vera: "Even if she wants the best for you..."
            Vera: "Isn't that something you need to achieve for yourself?"
            
            -> "I guess you're right..."
                Vera: "I know you might be close to her."
                Vera: "But if she isn't respecting who you are..."
                Vera: "If she cannot see Charlotte as her child..."
                Vera: "Then does she deserve any respect that you give her?"

    Vera: "We will not go gently into the night, et cetera."
    Vera: "But you gotta be ready, girl. This may be the toughest fight of your life."
    You: "What do you think she'll say?"
    Vera: "If she's as conservative as my mum..."
    Vera: "She may pose ultimatums."
    Vera: "Or she may appeal to your sentimentality."
    Vera: "Or she may threaten to reveal Charlotte to your dad..."
    Vera: "Wait, is your dad supportive?"
    You: "Hell no!"
    Vera: "Heh. One more thing we have in common."
    Vera: "So, which situation do you want to explore?"

    -> "Sentimentality."
        Vera: "She's gonna plead with you."
        Vera: "Expect her to exclusively identify you as her son."
        Vera: "I don't know about you, but that messed with me. A lot."
        Vera: ""

    -> "Ultimatums."
        Vera: "She's gonna play the disown card."
        Vera: "This is gonna be hard to defend against."
        Vera: "Other than that, she'll ask for your promise to not transition."
        Vera: "So the question is, which of these are you willing to accept?"

        -> "None of them!"
            Vera: "Well, we can't have a cake and eat it at the same time."
            Vera: "At some point, we need to choose."

        -> "I'd rather be disowned."
            Vera: "Woah. That's... tough."
            Vera: "I don't think I've ever heard anyone say that."
            Vera: "It's different from leaving an abusive household willingly..."
            Vera: "Even I wouldn't dare go through with it."
        
        -> "I'd rather promise to not transition."
            Vera: "I mean, I guess that's fair."
            Vera: "But consider this, is she gonna stop there?"
            Vera: "If she already cannot accept her son turning into a woman..."
            Vera: "Will she really accept her son just dressing like one?"

    -> "The one where my dad gets involved."
        Vera: "Heh. Well, you know how masculinity is, right?"
        Vera: "Replace sentimentality with aggression."
        Vera: "But just know, if things get violent, call the police, alright?"
        Vera: "As much as I study about how it's a flawed institution..."
        Vera: "At least they can provide some legal protection if hands start flying."
        Vera: "Wait. I'm sorry... I didn't even consider if your dad was abusive."
        Vera: "I'm really sorry if he isn't..."

        -> "He still is."
            Vera: "Oh my goodness. I'm so sorry to hear that..."
            Vera: "No wonder you still stay in school."

        -> "He was."
            Vera: "Ugh... well, I guess that's common."
            Vera: "And note, common, not normal."
            Vera: "I know there's lots of takes on this, but a parent should never abuse their kid..."
            Vera: "Sorry to hear about that, Charlotte."

        -> "He never was."
            Vera: "Huh. And I thought all Asian parents would take out the cane, or the slipper, at some point."
            Vera: "Well, you're luckier than most."
            Vera: "Sorry for assuming the worst from the get go."

        Vera: "Well, either way, it might be best to not involve your dad at all."

        Vera: "What? That's not possible."
        Vera: "I know it's not right to stereotype the older generation..."
        Vera: "But it seems you and I both got the strictest kind of parents."
        Vera: "Minimising damage means hiding and repressing Charlotte."
        Vera: "Does that sound like a long-term solution to you?"

        -> "Yes."
            Vera: "No it isn't!"

            Vera: "You're gonna slip up."

                Vera: "Sometimes, it isn't. But most times we can learn from it."

                Vera: "But for people like us, the light at the end of the tunnel is what makes it worth it."

    Vera: "Well, either way, this is the biggest decision you'll make in your life."
