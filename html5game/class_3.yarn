Chenjie: "Yikes, you look exhausted." 
You: "That obvious?" 
Chenjie: "Yeah, you have some serious eye bags... Did you sleep really poorly last night?" 
You shrug.

Prof Lim: "I tried to get another time slot because I knew this isn't ideal but..."
Prof Lim: "I do appreciate you all coming to class early in the morning."
Prof Lim: "Now, today, the topic will be on LGBTQ in the Media."
Prof Lim: "As usual, we shall start with some discussion questions."
Prof Lim: "How does the media represent LGBTQ people in Singapore."
Prof Lim: "Are there queer spaces for LGBTQ people in Singapore?"
Prof Lim: "What do you think makes LGBTQ representation in the media complex?"
Prof Lim: "Alright, discuss these questions in your groups."
<<goto_room_class_1_discussion()>>

Chenjie: "I think there are...?"
-> "It's hard to even find any LGBTQ characters in Singapore media."
    You: "I feel like we just sort of... ignore the existence of LGBTQ people in general, even in media."
    Chenjie: "Yeah, that's why there are hardly any queer characters, and when they do appear, they're... perverts and stuff..." 
    Joanne: "Yeah, representation just isn't great."

-> "But what good LGBTQ representation is there in Singapore?"
    Sage: "I really don't think there are any."
    Joanne: "I think there are... For example, influencers."
    Chenjie: "Yeah, I think it's definitely more lax if you are an independent creator or something."
    Sage: "Oh, right... Like Kumar maybe?"
    Sage: "And I know there are also quite a few influencers on TikTok and Instagram who are very openly queer."

        Sage: "What counts as 'promotion' anyway? Is normalising it 'promotion'? Is depicting a happy queer person?"

You: "I mean, honestly, I can see why the Singapore government wants to prevent promotion of LGBTQ lifestyles in the media..."
Sage: "Why?" 

-> "We have a declining birthrate."
    You: "If you promote non-heterosexual lifestyles, our declining birthrate might get worse."
    You: "It's for the greater good."
    Sage: "That's ridiculous. There are so many other factors that are causing the declining birth rates, like cost of living, lack of work-life balance, and so on."
    You: "It's still one of the factors."
    Joanne: "Dude, what are you even saying?"

    You: "They report when something comes up, like ministers talking about LGBTQ issues or during the Pink Dot period."
    You: "And they're not particularly inflammatory towards LGBTQ people either."
    You: "It's good journalism to only publish newsworthy stories."
    You: "So they're likely not talking about it because it just isn't relevant."

-> "You only see good representation from non-mainstream news."
    Chenjie: "You mean, like alternative news outlets?"
    You: "Yeah, the mainstream news outlets hardly ever acknowledge the existence of LGBTQ people unless absolutely necessary."
    You: "Why are LGBTQ people only shown on the news when it's a sensational or hot topic? Why can't we have conversations about our daily experiences?"
    Joanne: "It's hard to make the news about daily experiences, right?"

Joanne: "I mean, I think it's difficult to do that... It's not exactly newsworthy in Singapore, right?"
Sage: "The news is for bringing up issues the people should know about though."
Sage: "How do we inform the people of the difficulties LGBTQ+ people face if we don't even talk about it in the news?"
Joanne: "True... Like BTO stuff, right? Gays and lesbians can't really get a BTO until they are 35."
Sage frowns and sighs loudly.
Sage: "I mean..."
Sage: "Yeah... Housing is definitely a huge issue for queer people."
Chenjie: "I mean, it's quite in line with the second question. Are there queer spaces for LGBTQ people in Singapore?"

    Sage: "Singapore doesn't even accept the existence of LGBTQ folk."

    <<addExperience(5)>>
    Sage: "Yeah, and then they changed the constitution so it will be harder to reach marriage equality." (+5 XP)
    Sage: "You know, that's sooo great for queer people."

    <<changeRelationship("S", 5)>>
