    Joanne: "... Could you... wear something else?"
    You: "Like what?"
    Joanne: "Don't dress like a girl. It's very awkward for me, you know?"
    You: "I didn't bring any spare clothes though..."
    Joanne: "... Fine. I'll just let you do it this time. But next time, can you not dress weird?"
    
    -> "Okay, I won't dress like this."

Joanne: "We should get something to eat. How does western food sound?"
You: "Sure!"
You two get burgers at a cafe and continue to chat after finishing your meal.
You: "How's school?"
Joanne: "Same old, same old."
Joanne: "Just with the added stress of needing to seriously consider what to do when I graduate."
You: "Oh... Right..."
Joanne: "We're the same graduating batch, right? Have you started applying for a job yet?"

-> "I've applied to a few places already."
    Joanne: "Like where?"
    You: "Some management trainee positions. Some journalist positions."
    You: "But most places seem to be having a hiring freeze."
    Joanne: "Is that so?"
    Joanne: "Honestly, I don't have much of a clue because I'm not applying for any jobs."
    You: "When do you intend to start then?"
    Joanne: "Ah, no. What I meant is that I don't intend to apply to any jobs at all."
-> "Not yet. I'm planning to get my Masters."
    Joanne: "You have to write a research paper or something, right?"
    Joanne: "You have a topic in mind already?"
    You: "I think I want to look into digital and citizen journalism. Not sure what about it yet though."
    Joanne: "Digital and citizen journalism, huh."
    Joanne: "Could be interesting... Like the dangers of it, right?"
    Joanne: "Misinformation is spread like wildfire because almost anyone can just make the wildest claims."
    You: "That's one of them."
    You: "And also, people who otherwise might not be able to share their story can do so now too."
    Joanne: "That's true."
    You: "What about yourself?"
-> "Not yet. I'm planning to chill for as long as I can."
    Joanne: "I understand that."
    Joanne: "Sometimes, I wish time would just stop so I don't have to worry so much about the future."
    You: "I get that..."
    You: "It's incredibly stressful trying to plan for the future when it also feels so uncertain."
    Joanne: "Exactly."
    Joanne: "But I can't afford to rest on my laurels if I want to accomplish my goals."
    You: "And what is that?"
Joanne: "I want to start my own business as a wedding planner, you see."
Joanne: "So I'll get a wedding planning certification right after graduation!"
You: "That's interesting! I didn't know there was a certification you can get for that!"
Joanne: "Yeah! It's really comprehensive, which is important for wedding planners since we have to wear so many hats."
You: "Why wedding planning?"
Joanne: "Isn't every little girls' dream to have the perfect wedding?"
Joanne: "But in reality, planning for the wedding is incredibly stressful. There are so many decisions they need to make."
Joanne: "The gown, the location, table and guest arrangements, even the centrepieces!"
Joanne: "I want to make their most blissful day come true without them having to go through a ton of undue stress."
Joanne: "Sorry for rambling on. I know guys don't get it, but it's really important to get that day just right for us girls."
-> "You are very passionate about weddings."
    Joanne: "Yeah, it's a bit embarrassing."
    Joanne: "I know it's such a girly thing, and I look the type."
    Joanne: "But I can't help being a girls' girl, you know? I just want to help uplift other women."
    -> "Uplifting women is really important."
        Joanne: "Yeah. Society is still rather harsh on women... There are a lot of sexist assholes out there."
        Joanne: "That's why it's important to learn more about the female perspective."
        You: "I agree."
        Joanne: "That's why you signed up for the feminism class, right?"
        Joanne: "It's nice to see guys like you and Chenjie taking the effort to learn about the social movement."

        You: "Yeah, everyone has such different opinions on the matter."

        Joanne: "Like you and me, right? It's nice that a guy like you understands."
        She gives you a radiant grin, but it doesn't lessen the sting of the words "a guy like you".
        -> "Could you not group me with other guys?"
            Joanne: "Hm? Oh, of course, of course."

            [i]Joanne bites her lip in discomfort.[/i]
            Joanne: "I think you're just confused... I mean, I get that dresses and stuff are pretty and all, but you don't actually want to be a girl."
            You: "I don't?"
            Joanne: "Yeah, maybe it's some sort of jealousy?"
            Joanne: "Or because after you've become more knowledgeable on feminist issues, you've come to hate being lumped in with other men."
            Joanne: "I get that... For me, sometimes, I worry I'm perpetuating sexist stereotypes..."
            Joanne: "You know, I'm not good at maths, and I like flowery and cutesy things, and I play more cosy games than fighting games..."
            Joanne: "But you shouldn't hate your own gender."
            -> "This is different."
                You: "I'm fairly certain that isn't why I feel this way."

            Joanne: "Okay, to be very clear, I don't hate on trans women."
            Joanne: "Like, there is a big difference between a trans woman and a man in a dress."
            Joanne: "But if you go through the big surgery, then yeah, I guess you become a trans woman."
            Joanne: "No man would ever mutilate himself like that."
            Joanne: "Just putting on a dress, putting on a ton of makeup and changing your pronouns is just..."
            Joanne: "Anyone can just pretend, you know?"

            -> "I guess so..."
                Joanne: "Like, if you went into the girls' toilet, you can't blame us girls being panicked about it, right?"

                You: "A lot of trans people go through quite a lot of stress because people refuse to respect their experience."
                You: "I get that you're worried about safety."
                You: "It's hurtful when you simplify things to whether or not someone is using the right toilet or not."
