//// Commented out the stuff that dont sit right with walking up
// You walk into the cafe. Looking around for Helen...
Helen: "Hi, are you Charlotte?"
You: "Yep."
Helen: "Ah, okay. I'm Helen. Nice to meet you."
<<goto_room_boss_2_1_seated()>>
// Helen "Ah, okay. I'm Helen. Let's get food first?"
// The two of you get your food and return to the table.
Helen: "Why did you reach out to me, anyway?"
You: "You're a crossdresser too. I need advice on some things."
Helen: "Yeah, you told me that over text. I'm just surprised that you would be so... open."
Helen: "You literally Googled 'crossdresser Singapore', saw me in the results, and reached out?"
Helen: "I'm not sure if that's bravery or recklessness."
-> "Times have changed."
    Helen: "Well thanks for reminding me I'm old. But what do you mean?"
    You: "I mean, in an era where you can find your life partner online..."

    You: "Is it that surprising that I'm finding emotional support online too?" (+10 XP)
    Helen: "I guess not."
    Helen: "Still, if I was someone worse, you'd be in for a bad time."
-> "I mean, you agreed to meet me, too."
    You: "So if you're saying it was unsafe for me to meet you, maybe it goes both ways."
    Helen: "That is... adorable. But that would mean I willingly walked into a trap."
    Helen: "Are you going to prove me wrong for trusting you?"
    Helen: "Anyway..."
-> "I really like reading your blog."
    <<addExperience(10)>>
    Helen: "Thank you! Hope you found it useful." (+10 XP)
    Helen: "Well, maybe not useful enough. After all, here I am explaining things in the flesh."
-> "I want to believe people are accepting."
    Helen: "Girl, please."
    You: "What's wrong with that?"
    Helen: "Nothing. I'm just surprised at how idealistic you are..."
-> "You're right... maybe this was a bad idea."
    <<changeConfidence(-5)>>
    Helen rolls her eyes. (-5% confidence)
    Helen: "Well, we're here already. Might as well make the best of our time."

Helen: "Are you very open with expressing Charlotte? It took me a lot of effort to even get to this stage."
You: "Yeah. School is very accepting."
Helen: "School? We're from the same university, right?"
Helen: "How are you so daring? When I was there, I never dared to bring Helen out."
-> "Times have changed."
    Helen: "Haiya. Yet another reminder that I'm old."
    Helen: "So much has changed in 10 years, right?"
-> "I have my own room on campus."
    Helen: "Ah. So did I."
    Helen: "But I never dared to present as Helen outside my dorm room."
    Helen: "I didn't want to know what the others would say about me."
-> "Are you saying I shouldn't bring Charlotte out, then?"
    Helen: "I'm just surprised no one has harassed you yet."
    Helen: "The fact that you're still going strong like this is good. For now."
Helen: "So I guess your friends are all accepting?"
-> "They're the best!" 
    Helen: "Oh, that's good to hear." 
    Helen: "I guess your generation's attitude is really different."
    Helen: "But the outside world isn't gonna be so kind."
-> "Meh, some of them could be better."
    Helen: "There will always be terrible people."
    Helen: "People who comment and criticise, of course."
    Helen: "But even just one stare, at the wrong time, can hurt."
