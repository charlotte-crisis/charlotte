It's that time of the week again. You're in the clubroom.
But Eleanor... isn't? Everyone is kind of just doing their own thing.
Nadia: "Oh. Hey, {$name}."
You: "Hi Nadia. Where's Eleanor?"
Nadia: "She's... busy. Had some leadership thing with the school."
Nadia: "According to her plan, we're doing typography this week."
Nadia: "If you need examples, there are some on the board. Or you could just talk to us."
Nadia: "But please... try not to start another fight, okay?"
-> "Why is she really not here?"
    Nadia: "What do you mean? She has a compulsory leadership session with the school."
    <<changeRelationship("N", -5)>>
    Nadia: "Please. Don't suspect anything that hasn't been proven." (-5% Nadia relationship)
-> "I didn't start it."
    Nadia: "Okay, sorry, I wasn't insinuating that..."
    Nadia: "Let's just maintain for today, alright?"
-> "Okay, thanks for letting me know."
    Nadia: "Yeah..."
    Nadia doesn't seem as bubbly as usual. Perhaps something is affecting her?
    <<set $diceroll = diceRoll($emp)>>
    <<if $diceroll >= 10>>
        You: "Uh, is everything okay?"
        Nadia sighs.
        Nadia: "Let's just get on with the art, okay? Relieve stress, put feelings to paper and all."
        You: "Yeah, well... if you wanna talk this through, I'm here."
        Nadia doesn't respond, but she flashes you the faintest smile before returning to her art.
    <<else>>
        Eh, what to do.

The room has always been quiet at this stage. Before the discussions began.
But without Eleanor to start the ball rolling, you get the feeling this silence will persist.
Nadia has put on Spotify's top 50, but it does little to assuage this feeling.

//Who do you want to talk to first?
//-> Vera
//    <<jump 3>>
//-> Anthony
//    <<jump 4>>

You sit at the table, writing utensils in hand, paper before you. What do you want to write?
Hmm... perhaps let's start with who we resonate with the most.
Try talking to them to figure out how they feel.

-> Anthony
    -> "All it takes is one bad day"
        <<changeRelationship("A", 5)>>
        You think of what that one bad day would be, and hang the words ominously over a dark scene.
        (+5% Anthony relationship)
        <<jump 6_Exit>>
    
    -> "The world is yours"
        What would that world be? One full of glamour and riches, or with boundless frontiers to explore?
        <<changeRelationship("A", 5)>>
        You try to strike a balance between both, with the words covering the whole scene.
        (+5% Anthony relationship)
        <<jump 6_Exit>>

-> Nadia
    -> "A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step."
        You envision a road before you, winding through challenges and obstacles...
        <<changeRelationship("N", 5)>>
        And you try to fit this very long slogan into the shape of the road.
        (+5% Nadia relationship)
        <<jump 6_Exit>>
    
    -> "Do what makes you happy"
        You could just put these words in the classic smiley face... Or you could think of what happiness truly means to you.
        <<changeRelationship("N", 5)>>
        Either way, it's a simple enough slogan to put to paper.
        (+5% Nadia relationship)
        <<jump 6_Exit>>

-> Vera
    -> "I see the woman within"
        That'll be very useful to remind yourself. It's almost as if Vera herself is telling you that.
        <<changeRelationship("V", 5)>>
        You sketch it out in the silhouette of an eye, trying to incorporate the female symbol into the logo.
        (+5% Vera relationship)
        <<jump 6_Exit>>

    -> "Trans rights are human rights"
        Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, isn't it?
        <<changeRelationship("V", 5)>>
        Your design probably isn't gonna be as good as Vera's, but the message is clear.
        (+5% Vera relationship)
        <<jump 6_Exit>>

-> None.
    You sure? Nothing?
    -> Yeah, not really feeling it today.
        Nothing comes to your mind. You leave the clubroom with a blank sheet of paper.
        Don't worry, we can come up with something afterwards. Away from everyone.
        Go to the door to leave the club room.
    
    -> Hmm, maybe I'll get some inspiration...
        Off you go.

-> Let's talk to them...
    Off you go.

    Vera: "Hey, Charlotte."

    Vera: "I see the woman within."
    You: "So mysterious."
    Vera: "It's relevant. It's on brand. I would have chosen that for today's task, but I had something better."
-> "Hey, Vera. How's it going?"
    Vera: "It's going. Last week's... encounter... it still stings."
    You: "Yeah... things got really too heated."
    Vera: "That's why for this week's assignment, I drew this."

Vera turns her paper around.
"TRANS RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS" is written in sparkling blue, white and pink.

    <<if !getNPCKnows("V")>>
        Vera: "Wait, who's Charlotte?"
        You give a quick summary of your experiences as Charlotte.
        Vera: "Okay, so..."
    <<endif>>
    Vera: "Why?"
    You: "Why what?"
    Vera: "Why bother? She's never gonna accept you. I know that from experience."
    Vera: "Don't you feel unsafe going up against the one person who opposes your existence?"

    -> "I've got to do this."
        Vera: "You don't have to do anything. Some people just can't be convinced."
        Vera: "Is this really worth it, Charlotte?"

        -> "She is my mum, for better or for worse."
            You: "And I can't run away from this forever."

                Vera: "I mean, you could rent your own place..."
                Vera: "But that's if you have the money for it."
                Vera: "Hmm, I guess you're right... I didn't consider you'd still be dependent on your parents for a while."
            
            -> "I can't keep lying to my mother."
                Vera: "Girl, please. Don't tell me you reveal everything to mommy."
                Vera: "Besides, you're being truthful to yourself. You want to be Charlotte."
                Vera: "If mommy can't see the woman within, that's entirely her problem."
                Vera: "But I guess keeping a secret forever is tiring..."
        
            Vera sighs.
            Vera: "I think you need to be prepared. She may never fully accept Charlotte."
            Vera: "I know I seem like a very extreme and publicly out person..."
            Vera: "But even I know you've got to compromise sometimes."
            Vera: "Any progress is better than none at all."
            Vera: "That being said, I really hope it works out."
            Vera: "If you can make it, if you can convince your mother that Charlotte is valid..."
            <<changeConfidence(5)>>
            Vera: "Maybe there's hope for us all." (+5% confidence)
            You: "Thank you Vera, that means a lot to me."
            You: "I'll let you know how it goes."
    
        -> "Yeah, you're right. I should just hide."
            Vera: "That's not exactly what I was going for, but yeah."
            Vera: "Remember, she's not your family if she doesn't accept you."
            Vera: "You've got every right to cut her out of your life if you want to."
            Vera: "Your happiness over hers. Especially for such a big part of your identity."

            -> "Well, that still doesn't give me a lot of hope..."
                Vera: "That's just called being queer."
                Vera: "There are no easy answers to questions like these." 
                Vera: "You're always gonna have to give up something."
            
            -> "But what will I do when I eventually have to talk to her about it?"
                Vera: "You should buy yourself time till you figure out your own answer."
                Vera: "An answer for Charlotte, by Charlotte."

            Vera: "So all I can say is, don't ever let other people tell you what being happy should mean."
            You: "Thanks, Vera... that was rather sobering."
            Vera: "You know I'm not usually like this. But it needed to be said."
        
    -> "I don't feel unsafe. I want to fight."
        You: "I cannot hide forever."
        Vera: "Then you gotta be ready, girl. This may be the toughest fight of your life."
        You: "What do you think she'll say?"
        Vera: "If she's as conservative as my mum, she may pose ultimatums."
        Vera: "Or she may appeal to your sentimentality."
        Vera: "Or she may threaten to reveal Charlotte to your dad..."
        Vera: "Wait, is your dad supportive?"
        You: "Hell no!"
        Vera: "Heh. One more thing we have in common."
        Vera: "So, which situation do you want to explore?"
        -> "Sentimentality."
            Vera: "She's gonna plead with you. Expect her to exclusively identify you as her son."
            Vera: "I don't know about you, but that messed with me. A lot."
            Vera: "Especially when she sent me my baby photos, ugh. I blocked her instantly."
            Vera: "Heh, I'm just surprised my parents are still paying for my school fees now..."
        -> "Ultimatums."
            Vera: "She's gonna play the disown card. This is gonna be hard to defend against."
            Vera: "Other than that, she'll ask for your promise to not transition."
            Vera: "So the question is, which of these are you willing to accept?"
            -> "None of them!"
                Vera: "Well, we can't have a cake and eat it at the same time."
                Vera: "At some point, we need to choose."
            
            -> "I'd rather be disowned."
                Vera: "Woah. That's... tough. I don't think I've ever heard anyone say that."
                Vera: "It's different from leaving an abusive household willingly... even I wouldn't dare go through with it."
                Vera: "But you are going to graduate soon, after all... maybe you could carve out a life for Charlotte."
            
            -> "I'd rather promise to not transition."
                Vera: "I mean, I guess that's fair."
                Vera: "But consider this, is she gonna stop there?"
                Vera: "If she already cannot accept her son turning into a woman..."
                Vera: "Will she really accept her son just dressing like one?"
            
        -> "The one where my dad gets involved."
            Vera: "Heh. Well, you know how masculinity is, right?"
            Vera: "Replace sentimentality with aggression."
            Vera: "But just know, if things get violent, call the police, alright?"
            Vera: "As much as I study about how it's a flawed institution..."
            Vera: "At least they can provide some legal protection if hands start flying."
            Vera: "Wait. I'm sorry... I didn't even consider if your dad was abusive."
            Vera: "I'm really sorry if he isn't..."
            -> "He still is."
                Vera: "Oh my goodness. I'm so sorry to hear that..."
                Vera: "No wonder you still stay in school."
            
            -> "He was."
                Vera: "Ugh... well, I guess that's common."
                Vera: "And note, common, not normal."
                Vera: "I know there's lots of takes on this, but a parent should never abuse their kid..."
                Vera: "Sorry to hear about that, Charlotte."
            
            -> "He never was."
                Vera: "Huh. And I thought all Asian parents would take out the cane, or the slipper, at some point."
                Vera: "Well, you're luckier than most."

                Vera: "You're gonna slip up."

                    Vera: "Then you're gonna repress and hide until you can't take it anymore?"
                    Vera: "That level of repression rarely ends well, Charlotte."

                You: "We wish him well, but his actions have consequences."
            
            -> "Yeah, I guess we can't just expel him based on bad vibes."
                Nadia: "He needs to at least apologise to all of us first."
                Nadia: "And redemption arcs are never cheap, right?"
                Nadia: "If you're truly redeemed, you're a far different person than you were before."
        
        -> "No. Vera was being histrionic."
            Nadia: "What does that word even mean?"
            You: "She's always been seeking attention. Even from the beginning."
            Nadia: "I don't think so, it's not like she dominated our discussions, right?"

            -> "Are you kidding me?"
                You: "Every single facet of her personality has been about LGBT."
                Nadia: "Yeah, but..."
                You: "Tell me. What do you know about Vera that isn't about it?"
                Nadia: "She's an anthropology major - "
                You: "Which she took because she's LGBT."
                Nadia: "Uh, she doesn't like AI art..."
                You: "If she used it maybe she wouldn't be drawing rainbows all the damn time."
                Nadia: "You know what? Vera is my friend. And so is Eleanor."
                Nadia: "And I won't tolerate it if you talk shit about them."
                Nadia: "Sure, they're flawed, but so is everyone else, and there's really no need to go so much into their issues."
                <<changeRelationship("N", -10)>>
                Nadia: "So you can take your hate and fuck off." (-10% Nadia relationship) <<set $NadiaEnded = true>>
                <<stop>>

            -> "Yeah, I guess she knew her place..."
                Nadia: "That's... not how I'd put it, but sure."
                Nadia: "Anyway, that's also a pretty harsh thing to say about her, isn't it?"
                <<changeRelationship("N", -5)>>
                Nadia: "You're starting to sound more like Anthony. I'd watch myself if I were you." (-5% Nadia relationship) <<set $NadiaEnded = true>>
                <<stop>>

        -> "I guess so..."
            Nadia: "Even for me, I've held CCA leadership before."
            Nadia: "But I've never had such fiery arguments happen in my organisations."
            Nadia sighs.
            Nadia: "Let's hope we're ready for them when we enter the real world."
