Nadia: "Oh yes, absolutely. I stay so far from school!"
Nadia: "I'm cramming all my lessons into just 3 days to minimise travel time, you know?"
Nadia: "And besides, I'm still in year 2. There's still time."

-> "So what's stopping you?"
    Nadia: "Can't get a room… It's super competitive."
    Nadia: "And, to be honest, I dread having to move so many things."
    Nadia: "So many heavy suitcases…"
    
-> "You should go for it."
    Nadia: "It's not that easy…"
    Nadia: "I need to be super involved in the hall activities, right?"
    Nadia: "and it's super expensive…"
    Nadia: "Whatever. I'll think about it later."

Nadia: "Anyway! What about you? You're still staying on campus, right?"
You: "Yep. Been here 4 years."
Nadia: "What's the best part about staying?"

-> "There isn't really one."
    Nadia: "Really?"
    You: "Well, not anything that comes to mind."
    Nadia: "Oh… then why did you stay all 4 years?"
    You: "I don't know… felt consistent, I guess."
    Nadia: "Okay…"

-> "The privacy."
    You: "Even before Charlotte, I appreciated being away from my family."
    You: "There was one weekend where I really needed to finish a project…"
    You: "I just sat in my room and kept going at it until it was done."
    You: "I swear, time flows differently when you don't have distractions."
    You: "And when I discovered Charlotte, I also discovered I needed a space to be Charlotte…"
    You: "So my room's the perfect place."
    Nadia: "Ah, I see… I'm sorry to hear about your family."
    Nadia: "But yes! Sounds like you're really enjoying yourself."

    -> "Would you enjoy time away from family, though?"
        You: "You seem pretty close to them."

        You: "You definitely need that space."

-> "The people."
    You: "They're all super fun to be around."
    You: "And most importantly they accept Charlotte."
    Nadia: "Oh? No one gives you trouble?"
    You: "Nah, people are kind. Not like in other places, though…"

Nadia: "Accountancy… well, it's stable enough, I guess."
Nadia: "Sometimes there's a whole lot of studying."
Nadia: "You would not believe how many tax regulations I need to read weekly."
Nadia: "Still, at least I'm not in the more cutthroat courses."

-> "Do you enjoy it?"
    Nadia: "Enjoy? I don't really enjoy studying."
    Nadia: "It's just kinda easy enough for me to do…"
    Nadia: "And a source of employment."

-> "What do you mean cutthroat?"
    Nadia: "Those modules which take note of everything you do…"
    Nadia: "Even your day-to-day appearance, not to mention your presentation attire…"
    Nadia: "Don't even get me started on the people."
    Nadia: "Like, it's not in the grading and all, but you can feel the pressure there."

Nadia: "What about your major?"

-> "Nothing remarkable about it."
    You: "I'm just a communications student."
    Nadia: "Uh… I guess you can communicate better then?"
    You: "Perhaps. But I don't see it."
    You: "At the end of the day, it's just a degree."
    Nadia: "I guess so…"

-> "Kind of a waste of time, honestly."
    You: "Maybe I should have studied something more employable."
    Nadia: "Eh? I thought communications should have quite a lot of jobs?"
    You: "None that I'm interested in."
    Nadia: "Hmm… well, hope you still found something useful."
    You: "If not, those school fees are all going down the drain, right?"

-> "It's great! I can study what I want."
    You: "There's a whole gender studies module within it."
    You: "I'm definitely going to tap on my experiences as Charlotte to do well."
    Nadia: "Oh slay! It's like the module was custom-made for you."

        Nadia: "They always talk about earning big la, 'hustle culture' la..."
        Nadia: "They'd fit right into business school, if they weren't already there."
        Nadia: "It's worse when they speak in their own jargon."

            You: "Thanks, but you don't need to be kind."
            You: "I know that some people look at me like I'm some kind of freak."
            You: "But still I persist in being Charlotte."
            You: "So if that's what you wanna aim for in your own CCA..."
            You: "Then own it, and I hope you really thrive there."
            Nadia: "Thanks for all that!"
