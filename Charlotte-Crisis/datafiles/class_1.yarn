Prof Lim: "Hello, everyone! Welcome to the Gender and Feminism in Media course."
Prof Lim: "I’m Lim Shu Hwa, and I’ll be your prof for this semester."

Prof Lim goes through the administrative details for the course. Standard stuff.
The final assessment for this class is a group project to write a research paper.
She also reiterates the rules of this course to ensure everyone keeps it a safe space for discussion.

Part of you wishes you could bring all these rules to your upcoming "talk" with your sister.
Maybe things will be easier then.
You still don’t really know how she’ll react.

-> It’s hard to tell her tone through text.
    There’s no use worrying now. We’ll wait till the weekends to properly talk with her.
    Prof Lim: "Alright! Let’s start the lesson with some icebreakers."

-> I think she sounded angry.
    She probably thinks I’m a freak or something now. 
    Why did I post that photo? What was I even thinking? 
    Prof Lim: "Alright! Let’s start the lesson with some icebreakers."

    First lesson of the semester and your attention is already drifting. Shame on you!

Prof Lim: "Get together in groups of three or four, and introduce yourselves with your pronouns."
Prof Lim: "Tell us a hobby, and a TV show that you like."
You turn your chair around.
Joanne: "Okay, hi! I’m Joanne, Year 4."
Joanne: "My hobby is gaming, and for TV show... I like Squid Game!"
Chenjie: "Chenjie. Also Year 4. I like to gym. But I'm not like a gym bro or anything."
Chenjie: "And I like Rick and Morty."
Sage: "Uh, I’m Sage. I’m in Year 3. I go by she/her. I mostly just doomscroll TikTok these days, and I also like Single's Inferno."

Chenjie: "What about your favourite show and hobby?"
You: "My favourite show is…"

-> Squid Game, like Joanne
    Joanne: "You like it too?"

    Chenjie: "It's so funny and sarcastic, right? But at the same time, the characters are really well-written."
    You: "And the relationship between all of them are also complex because of how real the characters are by themselves."

As for hobbies, you like playing table tennis, crossdressing and gaming. Which should you say here?

-> Table tennis
    Chenjie: "Ooh!"
    Sage: "I think the last time I played table tennis was in primary school."
    Joanne: "Yeah, it's a bit tricky arranging to play table tennis because you need equipment and an opponent, right?"
    You: "If any of you want, you could come to my RC. We have a table."
    Chenjie: "Really? Sweet!" 
    # (+5% Chenjie relationship)


-> Crossdressing
    Chenjie: "How did you start?"
    You: "It was just a costume for a Halloween party at first, but then it turned out to be more fun than I thought."
    You: "And now it's a part of me and my life."
    Sage: "Do you crossdress for special events only?"
    You: "Not only for events. I sometimes do it in school or when I'm out with friends."
    Joanne: "Don't you get weird stares?"
    You: "Sometimes... But I think it's bothering me less and less these days."
    Sage: "That's nice." 
    # (+5% Sage relationship)


-> Gaming
    Chenjie: "What kind of games?"
    You: "League, mostly."
    Joanne: "Oh... I'm not really into that. I play cosy games."
    You: "Oh, like Stardew Valley or Spiritfarer?"
    Joanne: "Yes! Both of those!"

Chenjie: "Hey, do either of you have a group for the final project already? Joanne and I were thinking of grouping up."
You: "I don't mind joining your group."
Sage: "Me too."
Chenjie: "Nice! I'll email the prof about our group after class."
Prof Lim: "Okay, everyone. Now that we've all gotten to know each other. I'd like to begin the first class activity."
Prof Lim: "I'm sure you all have read the readings on what feminist studies is."
Prof Lim casts a knowing look over everyone and some quiet nervous laughter bubbles up.
Prof Lim: "But, right now, I want you to take ten minutes to discuss with your group mates what feminism is in your own words. What is feminism to you and how is it related to you?"
Chairs shuffle again and the class goes back to talking with their group mates.
Chenjie: "Did you guys do the readings?"
Joanne: "I only read the one about research methodology. Seriously, why do profs expect their students to be doing so much reading in Week 0?"
Sage: "I skimmed through them. But there's really so much to read..."
Chenjie: "The semester's barely started and I already have a backlog."

-> "I read both readings." 
    Chenjie: "Then we're counting on you if Prof calls on us."
    Sage: "She's not asking us for the dictionary definition. It's what it means to us, right?"
    Chenjie: "Okay, okay. I'm just pulling your leg."

-> "There were readings?"
    Joanne: "It's sent to our emails. You should probably check that."
    Sage: "It's okay. It's not a lot. It's like... about 25 pages each?"
    Chenjie: "It gets worse from here. I hear some weeks we have 5 readings."
    You feel exhausted even from the sound of that.

Joanne: "So back to the discussion question. What's feminism to you?"
Chenjie: "For me, it's about equality, right? We want equal rights for all genders and sexualities."
Joanne: "Yeah... I hate it when women aren't treated as equals. When I hear girls being discriminated against heavily overseas, I get quite frustrated."
Joanne: "Especially things like job or education opportunities."
Sage: "I mean, according to the readings, it's also about race, disability and class."
You: "Yeah, so feminism to me is..."

-> "Equal rights for all." 
    Joanne: "Yeah, agreed."
    Chenjie: "Yeah, so regardless of gender, sexuality, race and all that."
    Chenjie: "Everyone is treated equally."
    Sage looks like she has something to add, but she is hesitating.

    -> Press her.
        You: "Sage, do you have something to add?"
        Sage: "What?"
        She stutters for a bit.
        Sage: "Maybe, not just equally? Different people have different circumstances and needs, right?"
        Sage: "Like, um, there's a difference between allowing straight pride parades and gay pride parades, right?"
        Chenjie: "In what way?"
        Joanne: "Because one is reinforcing rigid social norms and the other is celebrating LGB people."
        Chenjie: "Oh, that makes sense. It's like the thing where we don't give $500 to both the rich person and the poor person."
        Chenjie: "We give the poor person more because they need it more."
        You: "So it's about equity, not just equality."
        Sage: "Uh... Uh, right!"
        Sage still looks a bit uncomfortable.
        <<jump 12>>
    
    -> Let her be.
        Chenjie: "So we're done!"
        Joanne: "Can't believe it's the second last semester for me already... I hardly got to enjoy myself during the sem break."
        You: "Ugh, don't remind me."
        With plenty of time left, your group starts some small talk about what you did over the semester break.
        Sage looks a bit distracted.
        <<jump 12>>

-> "About changing society for the better."
    Sage: "Wow. That sounds very idealistic."
    You: "Feminism is trying to change a whole society, right? Doesn't that in itself sound pretty ambitious?"
    Joanne: "When you put it that way, it kind of does."
    <<jump 16>>

-> "Creating a society that accepts and empowers all people." [EMP: 3]
    You: "It's also about inclusivity. Not just giving equal rights, but also including marginalised people and respecting their differences." 
    # (+ 5 XP)
    Chenjie: "Right... Like how gay and lesbian people are scared they'll lose their jobs, right?"
    Sage: "Yeah, and I feel that in Singapore, it's always about tolerance."
    Sage: "Like, we sometimes have this very 'not in my backyard' way of looking at things."
    Sage fidgets with a pen in her hand.
    Sage: "But as a result, people can't imagine there being LGBTQ+ people ever being in their own community or own family."
    Joanne: "Yeah, people in Singapore tend to feel uncomfortable about these things."
    Joanne: "We're still a largely conservative country, and family values are important to a lot of Singaporeans."
    Chenjie: "There aren't that many LGBT in Singapore. So it's difficult to get used to them."

        -> "Don't say 'get used to them'. That's dehumanising."
            Chenjie: "Dehumanising?"
            You: "Yeah. You're saying 'get used to' like LGBTQ people are a nuisance."
            Joanne: "I'm sure he didn't mean it that way."
            Chenjie: "Yeah, man. Sorry, okay?"
            Chenjie: "I also don't really have much experience talking to gay and lesbian people. I don't really know what the right way of saying things is."
            Joanne: "It's okay. I think it goes back to the whole thing about tolerance versus inclusivity though, right?"
            Joanne: "So we need more conversations about this issue."
            Sage: "It's hard to even have any conversations about it though."
            Sage: "On top of all the homophobia, the government actually has media laws in place to prevent proper discussions about it."
            Chenjie: "I mean, on an individual level, we can talk to people and find out more."
            Sage: "Honestly, there are too many people who don't even want to talk to people who are LGBTQ+."
            <<jump 19>>
        
        -> "It's a chicken and egg problem."
            You: "People don't want to come out because it's risky to be out."
            You: "But also, it's risky because not enough LGBT people are coming out to talk about their experiences."
            Sage: "I don't know... It's not necessary for you to be out before you can advocate for a cause, right?"
            Sage: "You don't even have to be LGBTQ+ to do it."
            Chenjie: "True. True. It's not like animal rights activists are animals themselves."
            Chenjie: "I'm an ally!"
            <<jump 20>>

Prof Lim: "Let's hear from some of you. I heard some interesting discussions over there..."
