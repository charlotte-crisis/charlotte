Prof Lim: "Hello, everyone! Welcome to the Gender and Feminism in Media course."
Prof Lim: "I'm Lim Shu Hwa, and I'll be your prof for this semester."

Prof Lim goes through the administrative details for the course. Standard stuff.
The final assessment for this class is a group project to write a research paper.
She also reiterates the rules of this course to ensure everyone keeps it a safe space for discussion.
Bored, you start fiddling with your laptop.

Prof Lim: "Get together in groups of three or four.""
Prof Lim: "Introduce yourselves with your pronouns and your favourite hobby."
<<goto_room_class_1_discussion()>>
You turn your chair around.
Joanne: "Okay, hi! I'm Joanne, Year 4. My hobby is gaming."
Chenjie: "Chenjie. Also Year 4. I like going to the gym. But I'm not like a gym bro or anything."
Sage: "Uh, I'm Sage. I'm in Year 3. I go by she/her. I mostly just doomscroll TikTok these days..."

How should you introduce yourself now?
You're in girl mode, so saying you're Charles is weird, right?
But do you even want to be Charlotte, right now?


-> Introduce yourself as Charlotte
    You: "I'm Charlotte, Year 4. She/her."
    Joanne: "Are you a dude?"
    You: "Um... Not right now."

-> Introduce yourself as Charles
    You: "I'm Charles, Year 4. He/him."
    Chenjie: "As in Charles? You're a dude?"

    -> "Strictly speaking, yes."
        Sage: "What do you prefer though?"
        You: "Um... I'm not sure right now."
        Chenjie: "That's okay. But you want us to call you Charles, right?"
        You: "Actually... I go by Charlotte when I'm dressed as a girl."
        Chenjie: "Okay."

    -> "Honestly, I'm not sure."
        You: "I'm still trying to figure out if I'm a crossdresser or if I'm trans."
        Chenjie: "Oh, I see. That's interesting. But you want us to call you Charles, right?"
        You: "Actually... I go by Charlotte when I'm dressed as a girl."
        Chenjie: "Okay."

-> Introduce yourself as both Charlotte and Charles.
    You: "I'm {$name}, Year 4. I'm a crossdresser actually so I go by both she/her and he/him pronouns."
    You: "It depends on if I'm dressed as Charlotte or Charles on that day."
    <<changeRelationship("S",5)>>

You: "Not right now. But when I'm in boy mode, yes."

You like playing table tennis, crossdressing and gaming. Which should you say here?

-> Table tennis
    Chenjie: "Ooh!"
    Sage: "I think the last time I played table tennis was in primary school."
    Joanne: "Yeah, it's a bit tricky arranging to play table tennis because you need equipment and an opponent, right?"
    You: "If any of you want, you could come to my RC. We have a table."
    <<changeRelationship("CJ", 5)>>
    Chenjie: "Really? Sweet!" (+5% Chenjie relationship)

-> Crossdressing
    Chenjie: "How did you start?"
    You: "It was just a costume for a Halloween party at first, but then it turned out to be more fun than I thought."
    You: "And now it's a part of me and my life."
    Sage: "Do you crossdress for special events only?"
    You: "Not only for events. I sometimes do it in school or when I'm out with friends."
    Joanne: "Don't you get weird stares?"
    You: "Sometimes... But I think it's bothering me less and less these days."
    <<changeRelationship("S", 5)>>
    Sage: "That's nice." (+5% Sage relationship)

-> Gaming
    Chenjie: "What kind of games?"
    You: "League, mostly."
    Joanne: "Oh... I'm not really into that. I play cosy games."
    You: "Oh, like Stardew Valley or Spiritfarer?"
    <<changeRelationship("J", 5)>>
    Joanne: "Yes! Both of those!" (+5% Joanne relationship)
    Joanne: " I logged sooo many hours into Stardew already."
    You: "I've played a bit of Spiritfarer but not Stardew Valley yet."
    Joanne: "If you need any tips and tricks or advice on what mods to use, just ask me."

Chenjie: "Hey, do either of you have a group for the final project already? Joanne and I were thinking of grouping up."
Sage: "Um, yeah, sure."
Everyone else in class seems to also be forming their own groups, and you even overhear one group discussing ideas for the project already. 
You feel pressured to quickly secure a group.
You: "Oh, I guess, I don't mind joining your group."
Chenjie: "Nice! I'll email the prof about our group after class."
Prof Lim: "Okay, everyone. Now that we've all gotten to know each other. I'd like to begin the first class activity."
<<goto_room_class_1_seated()>>
Prof Lim: "I'm sure you all have done the readings on what feminist studies is."
Prof Lim casts a knowing look over everyone and some quiet nervous laughter bubbles up.
Prof Lim: "So, right now, I want you to take ten minutes to discuss with your group mates what feminism is in your own words. What is feminism to you and how is it related to you?"
Chairs shuffle again and the class goes back to talking with their group mates.
<<goto_room_class_1_discussion()>>
Chenjie: "Did you guys do the readings?"
Joanne: "I only read the one about research methodology. Seriously, why do profs expect their students to be doing so much reading in Week 0?"
Sage: "I skimmed through them. But there's really so much to read..."
Chenjie: "The semester's barely started and I already have a backlog."

Joanne: "So back to the discussion question. What's feminism to you?"
Chenjie: "For me, it's about equality, right? We want equal rights for all genders and sexualities."
Joanne: "Yeah... I hate it when women aren't treated as equals. When I hear girls being discriminated against heavily overseas, I get quite frustrated."
Joanne: "Especially things like job or education opportunities."
Sage: "I mean, according to the readings, it's also about race, disability and class."
You: "Yeah, so feminism to me is..."

-> "Equal rights for all." 
    Joanne: "Yeah, agreed."
    Chenjie: "Yeah, so regardless of gender, sexuality, race and all that."
    Chenjie: "Everyone is treated equally."

                Sage: "Maybe, not just equally? Different people have different circumstances and needs, right?"
                Sage: "Like, um, there's a difference between allowing straight pride parades and gay pride parades, right?"
                Joanne: "Oh, like, one is reinforcing rigid social norms and the other is celebrating LGB people."
                Chenjie: "That makes sense. It's like the thing where we give the poor more because they need it more."
                You: "So it's about equity, not just equality."

        Sage: "On top of all the homophobia, the government actually has media laws in place to prevent proper discussions about it."

    You had forgotten about it for a second, but suddenly you remember your text from your sister, demanding to talk to you.
    Your hands are clammy. 
    Do you even have any idea how to explain yourself to her? You don't even know what you are.

        Sage: "Although honestly figuring out what to do after self-discovery is super rough as well."
        Sage: "The world's just a rough place."

    You: "Is there a particular topic you're interested in?"
    Sage thinks for a while.
    Sage: "I think the LGBTQ+ one. That one sounds the most interesting to me."

Out of the corner of your eye, you see a notification on your laptop.
A message from your sister. You open it.
Sister: "Charles"
Sister: "Is that actually you in that photo?"
Sister: "What are you doing?"
<<goto_splash_1()>>
Below is a post about your JC class reunion. More specifically, a photo of you.
Wearing a dress and a full face of makeup.
You had wanted to make your debut as Charlotte, your "girl mode".
But you had totally forgotten that your sister is close friends with one of your ex-classmates.
<<goto_room_class_1_seated()>>
Shit. Your sister definitely knows you've read the message already.

-> "I'm crossdressing."
    Sister: "I know that. I have eyes."
    The words over text feel sharp and angry.
    No, it's okay. Your sister is just sharp-tongued sometimes.
    She could just be impatient and shocked.


-> "I like dressing up that way." #skillcheck #emp # 6
    <<set $diceroll = diceRoll($emp)>>
    [You rolled a {$diceroll}.]
    <<if $diceroll >= 6>>
        You: "It feels comfortable being a girl once in a while."
        You: "I'll explain when I come home for the weekend, okay?"
        Sister: "Sure. Let's talk on Saturday."
        You were the one who suggested to talk but... what do you plan to say to her?
    <<else>>
        Sister: "But why?"
        Your sister's status is typing for a good 30 seconds. But then, the message that follows is short.
        Sister: "We'll talk about this on Saturday."
        Talk? What does she even want to talk about?
    <<endif>>

-> Stay quiet.
    Unfortunately, your sister won't do the same. She is typing again.    
    Sister: "We'll talk about this on Saturday."
    Talk? What does she even want to talk about?

How on earth do you explain that finding Charlotte was like finally finding a glove that fit?
Usually, being Charlotte is like heaving a sigh of relief.
However, as you stare at the photo, all you can see is how your masculine figure stretched out the evening gown.
Like a square peg in a round hole.
You wonder if you look like that even now and curl your shoulders inward.
Is your sister angry at you?

-> It's hard to tell her tone through text.
    There's no use worrying now. We'll wait till the weekends to properly talk with her.
    Prof Lim: "Alright! Let's start the lesson with some icebreakers."

-> She's definitely mad at me.
    She probably thinks I'm a freak or something now. 
    Why did I wear that dress? What was I even thinking?
    Prof Lim: "Alright! Let's start the lesson with some icebreakers."

Sage: "Yeah, not to mention the kind of changes you need to fix systemic oppression."
Joanne: "Yeah, but it's not as bad as in other countries already. In Singapore, women have equal rights as men."
Sage: "What? What do you mean?"
Joanne: "There's no gender inequality in Singapore. If you look at other places like... even the US where they're debating about abortion laws."
Joanne: "That's legit gender inequality because how can men who aren't the ones giving birth decide whether or not abortion exists as an option."
Chenjie: "Right?"

    Sage: "Even then, when you compare people who are in the same industry and position, women are earning less."

Sage: "That's why movements like Pride and Pink Dot are really invaluable for queer people."
Sage: "It increases their visibility, and helps rally the people who want to fight for the same cause."

TUTORIAL: Remember the Stats you customised before coming to class? INT, CHA, EMP, in the top right corner of the screen.
TUTORIAL: You'll use them to overcome Skill Checks. These are challenging dialogue options that need a certain amount of a Stat.
TUTORIAL: For example, a Skill Check with [INT 6] requires your INT to be more than or equal to 6 in order to pass.
TUTORIAL: However, you also get to roll a 6-sided dice to add to your INT Stat! 
TUTORIAL: If your base INT (in the top right corner) + the number on the dice is more than or equal to 6, you succeed.
TUTORIAL: Skill Checks are indicated by a red box with your percentage of success.
