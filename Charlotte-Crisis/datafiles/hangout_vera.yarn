You: "Hi Vera. How's it going?"
Vera: "It's going."
Vera: "Heh. Really though, it's nice to sit down and talk like this."
Vera: "So, I guess you came here with a purpose other than just coffee, right?"

Vera: "School is schooling, I guess."
Vera: "I'm passionate about what I study, but..."
Vera: "Sometimes my views clash with the prof's."
-> "Oh, how so?"
    Vera: "Some profs have been here long enough for you to feel their age."
    Vera: "And it's really annoying when they think they know it all, but..."
    Vera: "You know what, never mind. Things can get political real fast when I talk about this."

-> "You're saying you're... smarter than the prof?"
    Vera: "Hey, don't give me that look. It's not like they know everything either."
    Vera: "Theory is a useful framework but lived experience is ultimately more important."
    Vera: "So I defer to the prof's experience, but ultimately my opinions are my own."

Vera: "Well, you play games, right? So you'll probably get this reference, even if I don't."
Vera: "Profs are kind of like level 100 players and we're the level 1 players."
Vera: "They're teaching us how to get to level 100, but they are still players after all, right?"
Vera: "Anyway, that was just a sidetrack. What about you?"

Vera: "Huh, I didn't expect that."
Vera: "I thought gender issues would be very relevant to Charlotte."
-> "It's kinda difficult."
    Vera: "Hmm, well... is there anything that you'd like to know?"
    Vera: "Gender studies overlaps a bit with anthropology, so I can chip in."
    Vera: "But take my knowledge with a pinch of salt. It's also my opinion, after all."

-> "The teaching isn't great."
    You: "The prof lectures for way too long."
    You: "Then she throws us a question to discuss, which doesn't turn out very well a lot of times."
    Vera: "It's that bad?"
    You: "Sometimes my group mates go off on very long, self-absorbed tangents."
    You: "It just makes my brain tired."
    Vera: "Hmm, different strokes for different folks, I guess."

    You: "I mean, as a communications student, I'm here to learn stuff like advertising, PR, media writing, right?"
    You: "But here I am learning about why society is unfair."
    Vera: "Are you concerned about employability?"
    Vera: "I mean, that's valid, but that's also only one part of the picture."
    Vera: "And such theoretical knowledge will develop you not just as a worker but as a person."
    Vera: "In this era of late stage capitalism, isn't it even more important to keep your humanity?"

Vera: "Heh, what else would you have said, anyway?"
Vera: "Queer people in gender studies class... it's our natural habitat."
Vera: "I'm curious, though. What's it like?"
-> "Lots of class participation."
    Vera: "Oh, perfect. For me, at least. You know I'd be happy to share."
    Vera: "Maybe I'd fight people, but I'd hope it doesn't come to that."
    Vera: "Really, I'm just scared that I'd talk over other people. Especially if they want to share their own experiences."

    You quickly summarise your opinions of Sage, Chenjie and Joanne.
    Vera: "Well, that sounds quite heated. Didn't know your major was as argumentative as mine."
    Vera: "Still, just remember that you can always excuse yourself if arguments get heated, okay?"
    Vera: "Your prof should understand that. And if she doesn't, report her."

Vera: "Depends how far down the rabbit hole you wanna go."
Vera: "On the surface it's just 'equal rights for women', right? But that may not be enough in some cases."
Vera: "That's the reason why men sometimes think feminism is about female dominance."
Vera: "But it was never meant to be that way: the same problems and institutions that affect women, affect men too."
Vera: "So to me, feminism is... liberation. It's making life better for everyone by understanding women's issues."

Vera: "That thing in the eye of the bee holder, I guess."
Vera: "Okay, jokes aside, it's quite subjective. You'd know that."
Vera: "To define beauty would go beyond gender studies. Or anthro, for that matter."
Vera: "I know this isn't a satisfying answer, but beauty is what you want for yourself."
Vera: "Society might have a view of beauty, and your view might align with that, but views can change."

Vera: "Usually when people ask me this it's an insult."
Vera: "And they usually accompany it with trans women who don't pass."
Vera: "Personally that's very triggering for me, but let's answer your question first."
Vera: "I guess I'd define it as a social construct? The criterion for 'woman' has been different in every society."
Vera: "And despite what people might think, it isn't just people with vaginas."
