            You: "What better ironic punishment could we give than to be free and happy?"
            Charlotte: "So slay."
        -> "I hope he will accept you too, someday."
            Charlotte: "You think everyone deserves a chance?"
            You: "Even him. Besides, it's not like he's totally irredeemable."
            You: "He could have thrown us aside when things got rough for him, but he didn't."
            You: "So he must have his own set of values that he adheres to..." 
            You: "And that means I can connect with those."
            Charlotte: "It's still a pipe dream, but it's a good one, at least."
        -> "Even if Mother accepts you, I'm not sure he will."
            Charlotte: "Yes, I understand. So... a war is coming?"
            You: "Or an emigration. An exile. Whatever you want to call it."
            Charlotte: "Well, I guess it was about time anyway."
            Charlotte: "But we can still engage with Mother. Don't squander that chance."
-> "She was right all along."
    Charlotte: "Ugh... not this. Don't you know why I'm here?"
    Charlotte: "I'm here as proof. As evidence that we can live beyond her expectations!"
    Charlotte: "To do what makes us happy."
    -> "My happiness is less important than hers."
        Charlotte: "Are you hearing yourself? That's the most pathetic thing I've ever heard."
        Charlotte: "Just bowing down to the elders unquestioningly. Doing everything they say even if they don't know better."
        Charlotte: "This isn't the life you want."
    -> "There's gotta be a scenario where both of us are right."
        Charlotte: "She believes that men must remain men, and women must remain women."
        Charlotte: "Not much room for ambiguity and freedom there, don't you think?"

Charlotte: "Turning words into action."
Charlotte: "We can discuss all we want but it won't mean a damn thing."

    You: "And when we get past them, when I can assert my place in this world..."
    You: "It'll be a place with you next to me, and us with all the people who truly care."

    Charlotte: "You know what? I'm out of here. Enjoy the rest of your life as a man."
    Charlotte: "And when you inevitably dredge me up again, with all the shame and hatred that follows..."
