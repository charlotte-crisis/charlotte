You enter the club room for the first time.
The words "self-portrait" are projected onto the screen.
You should probably explore what and who is in the club room first.

There's a few pieces of paper and a box of colour pencils before you.
Before you can ask what you should do with them, a girl you've never seen before enters the room.
New Girl: "Hi! Wait. I don't think I've seen you before..."
You: "Hi, I'm {$name}."
New Girl: "Hello! I'm Eleanor. I kind of keep this club going, I guess."
Eleanor: "Today's theme is quite simple; self-portrait."

-> You: "Isn't that quite hard?"
    Eleanor: "Nah, don't doubt yourself!"
    Eleanor: "We all have to start somewhere."
    Eleanor: "Don't worry about whether your work is good, just get it out there." (+ 5% confidence)
    You: "Thank you for that."
    Eleanor: "No problem! We'll share our art in 20 minutes."

-> You: "That sounds simple enough."
    Eleanor: "Awesome! We'll share our art in 20 minutes."
    Eleanor: "Can't wait to see what you'll make!"

Eleanor: "Alright, let's pause, everyone."
Eleanor: "Shall we share what we've drawn? Who would like to go first?"
There's an awkward silence...
Eleanor: "I know we're all new here, but someone's gotta start first. Don't worry! No judgement."
Vera: "Alright, fine. Hi everyone, I'm Vera, she/her, and here's what I got."
Vera reveals her drawing. It's her face on a very psychedelic background.
Vera: "Yes, I know, lots of rainbows."
Nadia: "Hmm, it's a bit hard to see your face, but still, really nice!"
Anthony just shrugs.
You feel the pressure of four pairs of eyes on youâ€¦ what will you say?

-> You: "What do the rainbows mean?"
    Vera: "It represents my freedom to love, and to be myself." (+ 10 XP)
    Anthony: "Of course. Coming from someone who needs to introduce herself with pronouns."
    Vera: "I'll pretend I didn't hear that. Anyway..."
    -> You: "It looks nice!"
        Vera: "Thank you~ You like rainbows too?" (+5% Vera relationship)
        You: "I don't see a lot of them around. But yours looks good."
        Vera: "Yes, the world could do with a lot more colour."
        Vera: "I guess that's what I want to say through my art, too."
        Vera: "Anyway, who's next?"
        <<jump 8>>
    
    -> You: "It looks excessive."
        Vera: "Excuse me?"
        You: "Yeah. Too many rainbows. And you didn't finish your face."
        Vera: "Okay, fine. You didn't need to put it down like that, though." (-5% Vera relationship)
        Anthony: "Actually, I agree also. So many colours for what?" (+5% Anthony relationship)
        Eleanor: "Okay, moving on..."
        <<jump 8>>

-> You: "It's okay, I guess. Not much else to say."
    Vera: "Alright then. Next person?"
