You enter the club room for the first time.
The words "self-portrait" are projected onto the screen.

There's a few pieces of paper and a box of colour pencils before you.
Before you can ask what you should do with them, a girl you've never seen before enters the room.
New Girl: "Hi! Wait. I don't think I've seen you before..."
You: "Hi, I'm {$name}."
New Girl: "Hello! I'm Eleanor. I kind of keep this club going, I guess."
Eleanor: "Today's theme is quite simple; self-portrait."

-> You: "Isn't that quite hard?"
    Eleanor: "Nah, don't doubt yourself!"
    Eleanor: "We all have to start somewhere."
    Eleanor: "Don't worry about whether your work is good, just get it out there." (+ 5% confidence)
    You: "Thank you for that."
    Eleanor: "No problem! We'll share our art in 20 minutes."

-> You: "That sounds simple enough."
    Eleanor: "Awesome! We'll share our art in 20 minutes."
    Eleanor: "Can't wait to see what you'll make!"

Eleanor: "Alright, let's pause, everyone."
Eleanor: "Shall we share what we've drawn? Who would like to go first?"
There's an awkward silence...
Eleanor: "I know we're all new here, but someone's gotta start first. Don't worry! No judgement."
Vera: "Alright, fine. Hi everyone, I'm Vera, she/her, and here's what I got."
Vera reveals her drawing. It's her face on a very psychedelic background.
Vera: "Yes, I know, lots of rainbows."
Nadia: "Hmm, it's a bit hard to see your face, but still, really nice!"
Anthony just shrugs.
You feel the pressure of four pairs of eyes on youâ€¦ what will you say?

-> You: "What do the rainbows mean?"
    Vera: "It represents my freedom to love, and to be myself." (+ 10 XP)
    Anthony: "Of course. Coming from someone who needs to introduce herself with pronouns."
    Vera: "I'll pretend I didn't hear that. Anyway..."
    -> You: "It looks nice!"

        You: "I don't see a lot of them around. But yours looks good."
        Vera: "Yes, the world could do with a lot more colour."

    -> You: "It looks excessive."
        Vera: "Excuse me?"

        Vera: "Okay, fine. You didn't need to put it down like that, though." (-5% Vera relationship)

Nadia: "Uh... Okay, I'll go next! I'm Nadia, and this is my self-portrait."
Nadia pulls out... a picture of a man drawn in anime style?
Anthony: "Uh... wrong picture?"
Nadia: "Oh! So silly of me. Or is it?"
Nadia raises an eyebrow with a devious grin on her face.
She pulls out another drawing, this time of her side profile.
Nadia: "Yep, here's mine. I'm sorry I'm worse at drawing female than male faces..."
Vera: "It looks good!"
Anthony: "Even if it's very anime-styled."
Your turn to comment...

-> You: "Hmm. Why did you draw in anime style?"
    Nadia: "Well... I guess it's easier, right?"
    Nadia: "After all, it was designed for 2D artists."
    -> You: "So cliche."
        Anthony: "Well, I didn't want to say that out loud."
        Nadia: "Oh no..." (-5% Nadia relationship)
        Vera: "That's so rude. Let her live."

    -> You: "The anime style makes it good."

        Nadia: "Thanks! It's rare to hear that." (+5% Nadia relationship)
        You: "Let me guess, people laugh at you for being a weeb."
        Nadia: "Ya..."
        Eleanor: "Well, anime is pretty mainstream, right?"
        Eleanor: "Who knows, maybe we'll do anime in a future week! Then you can really cook."

Anthony pulls out a picture of an anthill, with ants all around it.
Anthony: "Hi, I'm Anthony. Ant-thony. Get it?"
Eleanor: "Uh... are you sure that's your self-portrait?"
Anthony: "What? It represents me, what. Insignificant, destined to be squished."
Vera: "Don't say that."
Nadia: "Yeah, that's quite self-pitying."

    Nadia: "The art isn't all bad."
    Eleanor: "Yeah, please, let's focus on the art here."

    Nadia: "Come on, he had 20 minutes. That's barely enough time."
    Anthony: "Then stick to drawing a male. You can see that in the mirror already."
    Vera: "I think Charlotte's drawing is good!"
    Anthony: "Don't be delusional. It's out of proportion."

-> You: "Drawing girls is hard."
    Nadia: "Big mood. It's so weird, I like guys, but I have this..." 
    Nadia: "I guess you could call it pressure on myself to draw girls well?"
    Vera: "Yeah. Doesn't help that a lot of reference models for girls don't resemble our bodies."

Vera: "Well, that's not a bad attempt."
Nadia: "Do you want an anime styled drawing? I can try that!"
Anthony: "So, just an average dude."
Eleanor: "For something drawn in 20 minutes, that's pretty good!"
Eleanor: "Come for more sessions and you'll learn more."
Eleanor looks at the clock.
Eleanor: "Well, that's everyone." 
Eleanor: "We've still got a bit of time, and I brought snacks, so please help yourselves!"

Vera and Nadia leave first, Anthony waits for them to go before he comes over to you.
