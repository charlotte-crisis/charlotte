You spend the remaining time with Sister making small talk about life.
Actually, you know what? Why am I, Charlotte, tolerating this?
I know you can't make that promise.
If you just said this so you could end this interaction faster, then you lied to her.
If you really mean this, then you're lying to yourself.
Either way, I'm gonna haunt you in your dreams.
