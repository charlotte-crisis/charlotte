After a short nap, you hop out of bed.

Who are you today? (Use the Up and Down arrow keys to choose an option, and spacebar to continue.)

-> Charles
    <<set $name = "Charles">>
    <<setGender(0)>>    
    You put on a T-shirt and jeans.
    
-> Charlotte
    <<set $name = "Charlotte">>
    <<setGender(1)>>
    You put on a dress. It fits you well, which has always been part of what motivated you to continue this hobby in the first place.

(You can interact with the mirror again if you change your mind.)
