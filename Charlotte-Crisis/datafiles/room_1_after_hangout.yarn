It's the end of the school week, and you usually head home for the weekend.
This time, you know your sister's waiting for you.
Dread it or run from it, the talk is going to happen.
When you step out of this room tomorrow, you will face her.
Have you learned enough from the previous days? We shall see.
Going to bed will continue to the next scene. You may still change your stats or clothes. Do you wish to continue?

Well, that was a fun hangout.
It served as a good enough distraction.
But you're going home tomorrow, where you'll see your sister.
(You can level up at your desk or change your clothes at your wardrobe.)
