You're a little early to the session today, and so are Anthony and Vera.
They are sitting on opposite sides of the room. Seems like last session wasn't enough to bring them together.
Behind his laptop, Anthony buries his head in whatever he's drawing, occasionally looking up at his screen.
Vera is scrolling through her phone casually.
Who will you sit beside?

<<declare $satWithAnthony = false>>
-> Anthony <<if getRelationship("A") > 30>>
    <<set $satWithAnthony = true>>
    // Sit next to Anthony
    Anthony: "Hi."
    You: "Hey Anthony. Drawing already?"
    Anthony: "Might as well, right?"
    You: "Well you're a dedicated one."
    Anthony: "If I'm bitchless in real life, who can judge me for wanting a waifu? 2D over 3D any day."

-> Vera <<if getRelationship("V") > 30>>
    // sit next to vera
    Vera: "Hey, {$name}."
    You: "Hey, Vera! What's up?"
    Vera: "Same stuff. Just scrolling through Pinterest. And Instagram. And TikTok."
    -> You: "For art ideas?"
        Vera: "Haha, I'd be a much better student if I was that dedicated, right?"
        Vera: "Only about 1% of what I'm seeing is vibes. The rest of it is fashion and trans politics."
    
    -> You: "Wow, that's a lot of social media."
        Vera: "Haha, I'd be a much better student if I could get rid of a few of those, right?"
        Vera: "I think it still helps me, though."
        You: "How so?"
        Vera: "I learn from trans content, at least."

Nadia and Eleanor enter the room together.
Eleanor: "Oh, you guys are here already!"
Nadia: "Guess we didn't need to rush."
Eleanor: "Alright! But... this is all we have?"
Vera: "Seems like it."
Eleanor: "Ah... I was expecting a few more people. This could have been a group activity."
Anthony: "What do you want us to do?"
Eleanor: "We're designing a T-shirt for the Art Club!"
Anthony: "Really? Only the 4 of us show up regularly and you still want a T-shirt?"

-> "Yeah, I'm not sure this is a good idea." //(+5% Anthony relationship)
    <<changeRelationship("A", 5)>>
    Eleanor slumps her shoulders a bit. She struggles to keep her face unchanged.
    Then, she shrugs.
    Eleanor: "Fine, hypothetically, we could make a T-shirt."
    Eleanor: "Those who are against the idea of a shirt, maybe... treat this as just any other graphic design exercise?"
    Nadia: "Sounds good to me."

-> "This could be the start of something new."
    Anthony: "What do you mean?"
    <<addExperience(10)>>
    You: "I mean, we've got to believe in ourselves because no one else will, right?" (+10 XP)
    You: "So maybe if we've got a cool shirt, people will ask who we are, and more people will be interested to join."
    Eleanor: "That's a great way to see it! Thanks, {$name}."

Eleanor: "Alright then, let's design for about 30 minutes and we can share."
You scour the Internet for ideas, eventually settling between three choices:

-> A paint blob with "Art Club" in the middle.
    <<set $logo = "blob">>
    Avant-garde, yet simple.
    You try not to think about how exactly you want to draw the blob, and put it to paper.

-> A palette and paintbrush.
    <<set $logo = "palette">>
    People will definitely associate this one with "art".
    You quickly sketch out the silhouette and touch up its various details.

-> A sunset.
    <<set $logo = "sunset">>
    You didn't need the Internet for this one.
    Sunsets have always held this allure for you. You love to appreciate their beauty at the end of a long day.
    And isn't that what art is about? Not just the final product, but the journey there.

Eleanor: "Alright, are we ready to share?"
Everyone in the room looks up.
Eleanor: "Okay, let's get started! {$name}, would you like to show us what you've drawn?"
You: "Alright, here goes..."

<<if $logo == "blob">>
    Anthony: "Uh... what am I looking at?"
    Vera: "Looks like a puddle."
    Nadia: "No, I think it's a blob of paint."
    You: "That's right."
    Eleanor: "If anything, it looks like the Nickelodeon logo. I think it's workable, but let's see if there's anything else?"
<<elseif $logo == "palette">>
    Nadia: "Okay, this one really says 'Art Club'. Very direct."
    Anthony: "Reminds me of Microsoft Paint."
    Vera: "We don't just do painting, though, right?"
    Eleanor: "Nadia has a point. An easily identifiable logo would be good on a T-shirt. Moving on..."
<<else>>
    Vera: "Looks like I'm not the only one with a weather feature for a logo."
    Nadia: "What do you mean?"
    Vera: "You'll see."
    Anthony: "How is a sunset related to art club? Are you saying we're going under?"
    -> "Yeah. Bye!" #skillcheck #cha #7
        <<set $diceroll = diceRoll($cha)>>
        You expected people to take issue with that, but Eleanor laughs.
        Eleanor: "As if we're going anywhere." (+5% confidence)
        Eleanor: "I like the concept! Colouring the gradient will be hard, but we can save that for another day."
        
    -> "Sunsets are nature's art." #skillcheck #int
        You: "And when do we see the sunset? After a long day, we truly appreciate its natural beauty." (+10 XP)
        Nadia: "Wow, that's deep!" 
        Anthony: "Fair point."
        Vera: "Hmm, do rainbows and sunsets come together?"
        Eleanor: "I guess we can search for that later. Moving on..."
    
    -> "Uh... I'm not sure. Sunsets look pretty."
        Anthony: "Many other things look pretty. Yours isn't that special." (-5% confidence)
        Vera: "Hate to say it, but yeah, I agree."
        Eleanor: "Then let's see what other pretty things you've drawn!"

Anthony: "Okay, here's mine."
Vera: "Wow, are those paintbrushes wearing ties?"
Anthony: "Yep."
Nadia: "Since when did we wear ties?"
Eleanor: "Maybe I should make that a rule."
Anthony: "Please don't."
Nadia: "I think I'd look good in a tie. But like, Avril Lavigne style, so with a tank top."
Vera: "That would be so slay!"
Eleanor: "Jokes aside, I'm a bit undecided about the ties."
Anthony: "I mean, that's what logo finder dot com gave me when I put in the prompt."
Vera: "You used AI to generate this?"
Anthony: "What? Normal what. Now everyone is using ChatGPT for their assignments, right?"
Nadia: "Touché. {$name}, what do you think?"
// Try touché without accent if cannot
-> "I think it's cheating."
Anthony: "Wow. Way to go, so direct." (-5% Anthony relationship)
Nadia: "Now that you mention it, I've seen so many anime fan artists get their work copied by AI."
Vera: "I just gave it a shot and damn, these logos are so generic and corporate."
Anthony: "Well, I guess that's what it was meant for, right?"
Vera: "Then why did you use it in a club that's anything but that?"
Eleanor: "Vera, please. I think there are some aspects we can keep. Moving on..."

-> "I think it's justified."
    Vera: "Seriously?"
    Anthony: "Told you so. Lots of companies are doing it nowadays."

    -> "I mean, only if you're stuck, right?"
        Nadia: "I guess. ChatGPT has got me out of a lot of academic trouble."
        Vera: "My friend once wrote an 8 page essay in 3 hours with it. But I don't think she did very well."
        Eleanor: "But the important part is that we edit it and make it our own work."
    
    -> "I also use it to edit my crossdressing photos."
        (if $Anthony_out = "false") Anthony: "What?" (-5% Anthony relationship)
        (if $Anthony_out = "true") Anthony: "Oh my god, not this gay shit again." (-5% confidence)
        You: "Yeah, if I don't have time for makeup before going out, I use FaceApp to edit my face."
        (if Vera doesn't know) Vera: "Love that for you."
        (if Vera knows) Vera: "I prefer the real Charlotte!"
        Nadia: "Yeah, I've heard of my friends jokingly doing that, but regularly? Wow."
    
    -> "If it makes life easier, then why not use it?"
        Vera: "Art isn't about finding the most efficient method. That's engineering! Or science. Or maths."
        Anthony: "Well, you know what they say, women can't do maths."
        Vera: "I would become a woman in STEM just to make you eat your words. But I'm enjoying my major too much for that."
        Eleanor: "Enough, guys. Let's just move on."

Nadia: "Okay, my turn!"
She shows a design of two students drawing each other while smiling.
Eleanor: "Wah, this one is good. Even if it's just a sketch for now."
Vera: "Yeah, you can always add the details later."
Anthony: "Anime again."
Nadia: "What's wrong with that?"
Anthony: "Nothing, nothing... just that you can only draw one type of art, huh?"
Vera: "What's wrong with having a preference? At least she's got something to be proud of."

-> "Nadia, you need to move on from anime. Get better material."
    <<changeRelationship("N", -5)>>
    Nadia: "And who made you the authority on good art?" // (-5% Nadia relationship)
    Anthony: "No, I agree. What happened to trying different forms?"
    Nadia: "I'll try different forms when Eleanor wants us to! I know there's, like, typography, pottery, drip paint and all that - "
    Anthony: "And then you go back to anime. I'm sick of it."
    Eleanor: "We all have our own styles, Anthony. Let's just move on."

-> "I wouldn't be caught dead with that on my back."
    Vera: "That was very cruel."

-> "What's wrong with anime?"
    Anthony: "Don't you think it's very cringey?"
    Vera: "It's a matter of personal taste. Who are you to tell Nadia what she can't and can draw?"
    Anthony: "Fine. I hope you enjoy your influx of sweaty weeaboos who think this is some anime club."
    Eleanor: "Anthony, we don't gatekeep anyone from the club."
    You: "Again, what's wrong with a majority of our club members liking anime?"
    Vera: "Exactly. We're small enough to not have an identity yet. Maybe this is what we need."
    Anthony: "Ugh. I guess if this club starts drawing hentai, I really need to reconsider what I'm doing here."
    Nadia: "You know that's not what I draw!"
    Eleanor: "Enough, all of you. Let's move on."

-> "Weren't you drawing anime waifus before our session started?" <<if $satWithAnthony>>
    Anthony looks away worriedly.
    Anthony: "It's... not the same!"
    Anthony: "And you shouldn't be looking at other people's drawings anyway!"

    -> You: "You literally acknowledged it to me."
        <<changeRelationship("A", -5)>>
        Anthony doesn't have anything to say. // (-5% Anthony relationship)
        <<changeRelationship("N", 5)>>
        You: "Sounds like you're just insecure in your preferences. But can you not give Nadia shit over hers?" //(+5% Nadia relationship)
        Nadia: "Anthony, I didn't know you liked anime too."
        Vera: "There's nothing wrong with that, Anthony. Not everything is cringe." (+ 10 XP)
        Anthony: "Let's... just move on."

        Anthony is thrown off by the strength in your statement, and keeps quiet.
        Vera nods in approval. // (+5% Vera relationship) 
        <<addExperience(10)>>
        Vera: "Yeah, think about that. We've given you space to show your work. Is that too much to ask for from you?" (+ 10 XP)
        Eleanor: "Okay, okay, moving on... Vera, your turn."
    <<else>>
        Anthony: "Oh wow, so we're not allowed to have our own preferences."
        You: "That is not what I said."
        Anthony: "Well then good luck with those who don't like anime. I'm sure I'm not the only one."

Vera turns her paper around.
It's a butterfly with rainbow coloured wings.
Nadia: "Rainbows again? That's becoming your trademark already!"
Vera: "Yep. Rainbows are colourful! It can mean many things: diversity, creativity, acceptance..."
Anthony gives an exasperated sigh.
Eleanor: "What's wrong, Anthony?"
Anthony: "Nothing. Just... I can't imagine anyone would want to wear this shirt."
Vera: "Why?"
Anthony: "Don't you think it's just a little loud? And there's no indication that we're the Art Club at all."
Nadia: "I guess so. I mean, maybe people will think we're some butterfly club."

-> "Yeah, what's with that butterfly, anyway?"
    Vera blushes a bit.
    Vera: "I think it represents transformation. You know, from caterpillar to butterfly."
    Vera: "I've always been intrigued by that possibility."
    (if Vera knows) Vera: "I'm sure you understand that well, Charlotte."
    (if Anthony knows) Anthony: "Oh my god, not this gender nonsense again."

-> "I'm not a fan of the logo, but I appreciate Vera's efforts." <<if $emp >= 4>>
    It's Vera's turn to sigh.
    <<changeRelationship("V", 5)>>
    Vera: "Thanks, {$name}."
    Anthony: "Then she should be okay with us not accepting it."
    Vera: "Well, yeah, it was just a suggestion."
    Vera: "Still, I feel like there's some... other reason you don't like my logo, right, Anthony?"
    Anthony: "Don't put words into my mouth."

-> "Isn't there something else that can symbolise inclusivity?"
    Anthony: "Like what?"
    You think for a moment.
    
    (if INT < 4) You: "Uh... Sorry. I'm not sure."
    Anthony: "Then we shouldn't make that the focus of the logo."
    
    (if INT => 4) You: "An umbrella."
    Anthony: "What?"
    Vera: "Why?"
    You: "You know... an umbrella can bring everyone together under it!"
    You: "And if you colour the umbrella rainbow, it'll be less obvious than an outright rainbow."
    You: "Win-win?" (+ 10 XP)
    Eleanor: "Hmm... we'd have to explain why our logo is an umbrella, though."
    Eleanor: "But it could just be one part of the design. Thanks, {$name}!"

-> "I think her logo is good. Yours could never compare."
    Anthony: "Then, as a guy, tell me, are you willing to wear this shirt?"
    -> "Yes!"
        Anthony directs his glare away from you.
        Anthony: "Siao lang. Wear rainbow and all."
        (if Anthony knows) Anthony: "Of course you would wear a rainbow."
    -> "No..."
        Anthony: "Told you."
        (if Anthony knows) Anthony: "You might as well stop pretending and just wear it."

-> "Yeah, the logo is inappropriate."
Anthony: "Exactly, our other members don't like it."
Vera: "Speak for yourself. I like it."
Anthony: "Your word against mine. And the others'."
