You're a little early to the session today, and so are Anthony and Vera.
They are sitting on opposite sides of the room. Seems like last session wasn't enough to bring them together.
Behind his laptop, Anthony buries his head in whatever he's drawing, occasionally looking up at his screen.
Vera is scrolling through her phone casually.
Who will you sit beside?

<<declare $satWithAnthony = false>>
-> Anthony <<if getRelationship("A") > 30>>
    <<set $satWithAnthony = true>>
    // Sit next to Anthony
    Anthony: "Hi."
    You: "Hey Anthony. Drawing already?"
    Anthony: "Might as well, right?"
    You: "Well you're a dedicated one."
    Anthony: "If I'm bitchless in real life, who can judge me for wanting a waifu? 2D over 3D any day."

-> Vera <<if getRelationship("V") > 30>>
    // sit next to vera
    Vera: "Hey, {$name}."
    You: "Hey, Vera! What's up?"
    Vera: "Same stuff. Just scrolling through Pinterest. And Instagram. And TikTok."
    -> You: "For art ideas?"
        Vera: "Haha, I'd be a much better student if I was that dedicated, right?"
        Vera: "Only about 1% of what I'm seeing is vibes. The rest of it is fashion and trans politics."
    
    -> You: "Wow, that's a lot of social media."
        Vera: "Haha, I'd be a much better student if I could get rid of a few of those, right?"
        Vera: "I think it still helps me, though."
        You: "How so?"
        Vera: "I learn from trans content, at least."

Nadia and Eleanor enter the room together.
Eleanor: "Oh, you guys are here already!"
Nadia: "Guess we didn't need to rush."
Eleanor: "Alright! But... this is all we have?"
Vera: "Seems like it."
Eleanor: "Ah... I was expecting a few more people. This could have been a group activity."
Anthony: "What do you want us to do?"
Eleanor: "We're designing a T-shirt for the Art Club!"
Anthony: "Really? Only the 4 of us show up regularly and you still want a T-shirt?"

-> "Yeah, I'm not sure this is a good idea." //(+5% Anthony relationship)
    <<changeRelationship("A", 5)>>
    Eleanor slumps her shoulders a bit. She struggles to keep her face unchanged.
    Then, she shrugs.
    Eleanor: "Fine, hypothetically, we could make a T-shirt."
    Eleanor: "Those who are against the idea of a shirt, maybe... treat this as just any other graphic design exercise?"
    Nadia: "Sounds good to me."

-> "This could be the start of something new."
    Anthony: "What do you mean?"
    <<addExperience(10)>>
    You: "I mean, we've got to believe in ourselves because no one else will, right?" (+10 XP)
    You: "So maybe if we've got a cool shirt, people will ask who we are, and more people will be interested to join."
    Eleanor: "That's a great way to see it! Thanks, {$name}."

Eleanor: "Alright then, let's design for about 30 minutes and we can share."
You scour the Internet for ideas, eventually settling between three choices:

-> A paint blob with "Art Club" in the middle.
    <<set $logo = "blob">>
    Avant-garde, yet simple.
    You try not to think about how exactly you want to draw the blob, and put it to paper.

-> A palette and paintbrush.
    <<set $logo = "palette">>
    People will definitely associate this one with "art".
    You quickly sketch out the silhouette and touch up its various details.

-> A sunset.
    <<set $logo = "sunset">>
    You didn't need the Internet for this one.
    Sunsets have always held this allure for you. You love to appreciate their beauty at the end of a long day.
    And isn't that what art is about? Not just the final product, but the journey there.

Eleanor: "Alright, are we ready to share?"
Everyone in the room looks up.
Eleanor: "Okay, let's get started! {$name}, would you like to show us what you've drawn?"
You: "Alright, here goes..."

<<if $logo == "blob">>
    Anthony: "Uh... what am I looking at?"
    Vera: "Looks like a puddle."
    Nadia: "No, I think it's a blob of paint."
    You: "That's right."
    Eleanor: "If anything, it looks like the Nickelodeon logo. I think it's workable, but let's see if there's anything else?"
<<elseif $logo == "palette">>
    Nadia: "Okay, this one really says 'Art Club'. Very direct."
    Anthony: "Reminds me of Microsoft Paint."
    Vera: "We don't just do painting, though, right?"
    Eleanor: "Nadia has a point. An easily identifiable logo would be good on a T-shirt. Moving on..."
<<else>>
    Vera: "Looks like I'm not the only one with a weather feature for a logo."
    Nadia: "What do you mean?"
    Vera: "You'll see."
    Anthony: "How is a sunset related to art club? Are you saying we're going under?"
    -> "Yeah. Bye!" #skillcheck #cha #7
        <<set $diceroll = diceRoll($cha)>>
        You expected people to take issue with that, but Eleanor laughs.
        Eleanor: "As if we're going anywhere." (+5% confidence)
        Eleanor: "I like the concept! Colouring the gradient will be hard, but we can save that for another day."
        
    -> "Sunsets are nature's art." #skillcheck #int
        You: "And when do we see the sunset? After a long day, we truly appreciate its natural beauty." (+10 XP)
        Nadia: "Wow, that's deep!" 
        Anthony: "Fair point."
        Vera: "Hmm, do rainbows and sunsets come together?"
        Eleanor: "I guess we can search for that later. Moving on..."
    
    -> "Uh... I'm not sure. Sunsets look pretty."
        Anthony: "Many other things look pretty. Yours isn't that special." (-5% confidence)
        Vera: "Hate to say it, but yeah, I agree."
        Eleanor: "Then let's see what other pretty things you've drawn!"

Anthony: "Okay, here's mine."
Vera: "Wow, are those paintbrushes wearing ties?"
Anthony: "Yep."
Nadia: "Since when did we wear ties?"
Eleanor: "Maybe I should make that a rule."
Anthony: "Please don't."
Nadia: "I think I'd look good in a tie. But like, Avril Lavigne style, so with a tank top."
Vera: "That would be so slay!"
Eleanor: "Jokes aside, I'm a bit undecided about the ties."
Anthony: "I mean, that's what logo finder dot com gave me when I put in the prompt."
Vera: "You used AI to generate this?"
Anthony: "What? Normal what. Now everyone is using ChatGPT for their assignments, right?"
Nadia: "Touché. {$name}, what do you think?"
// Try touché without accent if cannot
-> "I think it's cheating."
Anthony: "Wow. Way to go, so direct." (-5% Anthony relationship)
Nadia: "Now that you mention it, I've seen so many anime fan artists get their work copied by AI."
Vera: "I just gave it a shot and damn, these logos are so generic and corporate."
Anthony: "Well, I guess that's what it was meant for, right?"
Vera: "Then why did you use it in a club that's anything but that?"
Eleanor: "Vera, please. I think there are some aspects we can keep. Moving on..."

-> "I think it's justified."
    Vera: "Seriously?"
    Anthony: "Told you so. Lots of companies are doing it nowadays."

    -> "I mean, only if you're stuck, right?"
        Nadia: "I guess. ChatGPT has got me out of a lot of academic trouble."
        Vera: "My friend once wrote an 8 page essay in 3 hours with it. But I don't think she did very well."
        Eleanor: "But the important part is that we edit it and make it our own work."
    
    -> "I also use it to edit my crossdressing photos."

        Nadia: "Yeah, I've heard of my friends jokingly doing that, but regularly? Wow."
    
    -> "If it makes life easier, then why not use it?"
        Vera: "Art isn't about finding the most efficient method. That's engineering! Or science. Or maths."
        Anthony: "Well, you know what they say, women can't do maths."
        Vera: "I would become a woman in STEM just to make you eat your words. But I'm enjoying my major too much for that."

Nadia: "Okay, my turn!"
She shows a design of two students drawing each other while smiling.
Eleanor: "Wah, this one is good. Even if it's just a sketch for now."
Vera: "Yeah, you can always add the details later."
Anthony: "Anime again."
Nadia: "What's wrong with that?"
Anthony: "Nothing, nothing... just that you can only draw one type of art, huh?"

    Vera: "It's a matter of personal taste. Who are you to tell Nadia what she can't and can draw?"
    Anthony: "Fine. I hope you enjoy your influx of sweaty weeaboos who think this is some anime club."
    Eleanor: "Anthony, we don't gatekeep anyone from the club."
    You: "Again, what's wrong with a majority of our club members liking anime?"
    Vera: "Exactly. We're small enough to not have an identity yet. Maybe this is what we need."
    Anthony: "Ugh. I guess if this club starts drawing hentai, I really need to reconsider what I'm doing here."
    Nadia: "You know that's not what I draw!"
    Eleanor: "Enough, all of you. Let's move on."

-> "Weren't you drawing anime waifus before our session started?" <<if $satWithAnthony>>
    Anthony looks away worriedly.

Vera turns her paper around.
It's a butterfly with rainbow coloured wings.
Nadia: "Rainbows again? That's becoming your trademark already!"
Vera: "Yep. Rainbows are colourful! It can mean many things: diversity, creativity, acceptance..."
Anthony gives an exasperated sigh.
Eleanor: "What's wrong, Anthony?"
Anthony: "Nothing. Just... I can't imagine anyone would want to wear this shirt."
Vera: "Why?"
Anthony: "Don't you think it's just a little loud? And there's no indication that we're the Art Club at all."
Nadia: "I guess so. I mean, maybe people will think we're some butterfly club."

-> "Yeah, what's with that butterfly, anyway?"
    Vera blushes a bit.
    Vera: "I think it represents transformation. You know, from caterpillar to butterfly."
    Vera: "I've always been intrigued by that possibility."
    (if Vera knows) Vera: "I'm sure you understand that well, Charlotte."
    (if Anthony knows) Anthony: "Oh my god, not this gender nonsense again."

-> "I'm not a fan of the logo, but I appreciate Vera's efforts." <<if $emp >= 4>>
    It's Vera's turn to sigh.
    <<changeRelationship("V", 5)>>
    Vera: "Thanks, {$name}."
    Anthony: "Then she should be okay with us not accepting it."
    Vera: "Well, yeah, it was just a suggestion."
    Vera: "Still, I feel like there's some... other reason you don't like my logo, right, Anthony?"
    Anthony: "Don't put words into my mouth."

-> "Isn't there something else that can symbolise inclusivity?"
    Anthony: "Like what?"
    You think for a moment.
    
    (if INT < 4) You: "Uh... Sorry. I'm not sure."
    Anthony: "Then we shouldn't make that the focus of the logo."
    
    (if INT => 4) You: "An umbrella."
    Anthony: "What?"
    Vera: "Why?"
    You: "You know... an umbrella can bring everyone together under it!"
    You: "And if you colour the umbrella rainbow, it'll be less obvious than an outright rainbow."
    You: "Win-win?" (+ 10 XP)
    Eleanor: "Hmm... we'd have to explain why our logo is an umbrella, though."
    Eleanor: "But it could just be one part of the design. Thanks, {$name}!"

-> "I think her logo is good. Yours could never compare."
    Anthony: "Then, as a guy, tell me, are you willing to wear this shirt?"
    -> "Yes!"
        Anthony directs his glare away from you.
        Anthony: "Siao lang. Wear rainbow and all."
        (if Anthony knows) Anthony: "Of course you would wear a rainbow."
    -> "No..."
        Anthony: "Told you."
        (if Anthony knows) Anthony: "You might as well stop pretending and just wear it."

-> "Yeah, the logo is inappropriate."
    Anthony: "Exactly, our other members don't like it."
    Vera: "Speak for yourself. I like it."
    Anthony: "Your word against mine. And the others'."

Eleanor: "Okay, it seems like we haven't really come to a consensus here..."
Eleanor: "Which is okay. Maybe we just need a bit more time to decide."
Anthony: "Wait. Before we move on, there's something I want to ask Vera."
Vera: "Shoot."
Anthony: "Your logo talks about including everybody. But what about the straights?"
Vera: "What?"
Anthony: "Pride means gay, right? But where is the straight representation?"
Vera: "You can't possibly be serious right now."

-> "Rainbows don't just mean LGBTQ+. Didn't you listen to what she said?"
    Vera: "Thanks, {$name}. At least you get it."
    Anthony: "I still can't shake the association. I don't think our future members will either."

    -> "You know what else is rainbow coloured? Gaming PCs." <<if $int >= 4>>
        You: "Do you game, Anthony?"
        Anthony: "Yeah, sometimes..."
        You: "Think about it. If heterosexual men really hated rainbows, would they really buy a PC with lots of RGB lighting?"
        Anthony: "I guess not..."
        You: "But they do anyway. And it's not LGBTQ+ at all, not for them. They just wanna play games."

        Vera: "The fact that you're wearing a rainbow while doing it shouldn't make a difference."
    
    -> "I guess we'll have to agree to disagree."
        Anthony: "Then I guess I won't ever wear the shirt in public. Shame."
    
    -> "That's a you problem."
        Anthony: "Then I guess being a gay is also a Vera problem."
        Vera: "I don't see it as a problem. Only you do."
        Eleanor: "Enough! Guys."

-> "The straight representation is inbuilt." <<if $int >= 4>>
    Anthony: "What?"
    You: "Isn't the pride flag about diversity, about accepting everybody?"
    Vera: "Yes, that includes our straight allies."
    Anthony: "Then why don't I see any straight people wearing rainbows?"
    Nadia: "I will do it!"
    Eleanor: "And you can do it too, Anthony. Nothing's stopping you from it."
    Vera: "Is your masculinity so fragile that a rainbow will shatter it to pieces?"
    -> "Good one, Vera."
        Anthony: "Ugh. This club isn't the right place for me."
        Vera: "Honestly? You've been rude and judgemental to multiple members of the club. It's classic douchebag alpha male behaviour, and I'm not surprised you'd be so opposed to the rainbow." 
        Anthony: "I'm just saying my opinion. If you can't handle it, that says more about you than about me."
        Vera: "I'm surprised Eleanor isn't doing anything about you."

        Vera: "Nadia, didn't you feel insulted when he mocked your drawing style?"
        Nadia falls silent.

        -> "She didn't mean that, Anthony."
            Anthony: "Oh, of course. You praise her and then turn around to say she didn't mean that."

                You: "No count. I meant, real life."
                Anthony shakes his head.
                You: "Then I know it's difficult to understand at first. And your first time getting to know a queer person, you got scolded. That must feel bad. So on behalf of Vera, I'd say sorry."

        You: "I know you're pissed off at Anthony. But we have to be the bigger person here."
        Vera: "He refuses to understand what I'm saying. He taunted Nadia's art, and didn't produce any of his own."
        Nadia: "Honestly... I understand where he's coming from..."
        Vera: "You shouldn't just grin and bear it, Nadia. If I were you, I'd be a lot angrier."
        Nadia: "Well, yes. But I don't want to lose a member of the club over this."
        Eleanor: "Anger won't solve the problem, Vera. Your concerns are valid, but we don't want a full blown fight here."
        Vera: "Ignoring the fact that you're all cishet people trying to tell a queer person how to be offended, fine. I'll stand down."
        Nadia: "We're not invalidating your feelings, Vera. We just want peace and good vibes."
        Vera: "Then you should really question how we get there."

-> "That was a valid question, Vera."
    Vera sighs in exasperation.
    Vera: "Fine. Since you guys don't seem to get it, the rainbow is meant to represent our straight allies too. So it's not like pride flags exclude straight people."
    Vera: "But why is it that you want to intrude in our spaces?"

    -> "No, it's why you want to keep pushing your agenda onto us."

        Anthony: "Okay la okay la, any one of your 76 genders is welcome here, happy?"
        Vera: "I know that's not what you really think."
        Anthony: "Attack helicopter also can."
        Vera: "We're really going with that joke, huh?"
        Anthony: "Until you stop trying to make our club shirt a joke, sure."
    
    -> "We're not trying to do that."
        Vera: "Then what do you want? Cishet people are so complex sometimes."
        You: "I mean... weren't you ever confused about who you were?"
        Vera: "Of course."
        Nadia: "Then you should know that others are confused too. We don't mean harm. Straight people aren't the enemy."
        You: "Yeah, I think we all need a bit more empathy towards one another instead of just fighting..."
        Vera smirks.
        Vera: "That's such a straight person answer. But fine. Whatever. As long as you accept me."
        Anthony: "No one was rejecting you. You just gaslit yourself into thinking that."
        Vera: "That in itself is gaslighting, but I'm not feeding the trolls."
    
    -> "Wait, weren't we talking about the logo?"
        Eleanor: "Yes, thanks, let's get back on track."
        Eleanor: "I think we should compromise on this. The rainbow can still exist, but as a background element."
        Vera: "This isn't over, Eleanor."
        Eleanor: "Please. Take it outside. If we continue here, I might as well hold a sleepover in this classroom."
        Nadia: "Not a bad idea."
        You: "Wait, which one? The sleepover or continuing outside?"
        Nadia: "Yes." (+5% confidence)
        The joke earns a smirk from both Vera and Anthony, but not much else.

-> "Yeah Vera, don't you think this is a little too political?"
    <<jump 8_why>>
    

-> "Vera, hold it together..."
    Vera: "Sorry. It's just... so hard to explain this sometimes, you know?"
    You realise the burden is now on you to explain.

    -> "Anthony, no one's forcing you to wear this." (CHA => 4)
        Anthony: "But it's the club shirt. You think all of our members are gonna like the gay shit too?"
        You: "It's not just LGBTQ+. You gotta own the shirt. Make the design your own."
        You: "Sure, if you don't like rainbows, that's fine. We can change that."
        You: "But we gotta respect the people who put in effort to submit their stuff, right?"
        Anthony: "Not if it's trash."
        You: "You're standing on very shaky ground there, Mr logo finder dot com."
        Anthony looks away. He can't meet your glance.
        You: "All we're asking for is mutual respect, yeah? You don't like, you say it nicely. They don't like, they also say nicely. Okay?"
        You've managed to explain this simply enough for Anthony to begrudgingly agree.
        Anthony: "Fine. I'm sorry Vera, and Nadia."
        Nadia: "It's okay."
        Vera: "I'll let this go." (+ 10 XP)
    
    -> "Anthony, we're sorry." (EMP => 4)
        Vera: "What!?"
        Anthony: "For once, I agree."
        You: "Both of you have been fighting a lot. Someone had to take the first step to apologise."
        Anthony: "What's the use if it's an empty apology?"
        You: "I understand how you feel."
        You: "You're just a dude trying to make sense of the world, and enjoy it through art. We aren't so different."
        Anthony: "I'm nothing like you."
        You: "Are we? I'm new to our new friends here too, as new as you are."
        Anthony: "You can call them friends. I wouldn't."
        You: "If you'd taken the effort to know them, you could have." 
        Nadia: "It's not too late to make friends; isn't that what you're here for?"
        Anthony looks away, but you can see the doubt on his face.
        You: "Don't you think you should return the favour?"
        Anthony: "Fine. Sorry, Vera."
        Vera: "Sorry, Anthony."
        Eleanor: "That's a start." (+ 10 XP)
    
    -> "Actually, I think Anthony has some valid points."

Vera folds her arms.
Vera: "Why?"

-> You: "It's like those companies that only change their logo to rainbow in June and then change it back in July."
    Vera: "Yeah, but for us, it's our permanent logo design."
    You: "So it's political all months of the year. Which is worse. LGBTQ+ was never our identity."
    Vera: "I never wanted it to be. This isn't Gay Arts Club, though that would certainly be interesting."
    
-> You: "Kinda seems like this is a design for you, not the club."
    Vera is too flustered to answer.
    Anthony: "Heh."
    You: "Like, we get it, you're gay, but can you stop pushing it so openly?"
    Anthony: "Yeah, we're tired of seeing it so often." (+5% Anthony relationship)
    Vera: "What do you even mean?" (-5% Vera relationship)
    (if Vera knows) Vera: "I thought you'd be better than this." (-5% Vera relationship) (-5% confidence)
    Vera: "You seem to be overlooking the point that rainbows can also mean diversity and creativity. The stuff artists aspire to."
    You: "Yeah, but what if people are uncomfortable with the theme?"
    Vera: "Art is meant to disturb the comfortable and comfort the disturbed."
    Anthony: "And you're gonna disturb a lot of comfortable people who want to join our club."
    Vera: "That's just your personal biases getting in the way."
