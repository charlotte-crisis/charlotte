Narrator: You walk into the classroom. The chairs and tables, previously arranged in neat little rows, are haphazardly arranged into a circle. 
Narrator: There are some people sitting apart from each other. Who do you sit next to?

-> Player: THE GUY IN THE SPORTS SINGLET.
    Sports: Hey, what's up, bro.
    Player: Hello! I'm Jiayu. What's your name?
    Sports: I'm Anthony.
    Narrator: How is this guy not freezing to death in his tight singlet? Not even a shirt, let alone a jacket.

-> Player: THE PERSON IN THE BLACK HOODIE.
    Black Hoodie: Hi...?
    Player: Hello! I'm Jiayu. What's your name?
    Black Hoodie: Sage.
    Narrator: You get the feeling Sage doesn't quite want to talk to you.

-> Player: THE GIRL IN THE LAVENDER T-SHIRT.
    Lavender T-shirt: Hi!
    Player: Hello! I'm Jiayu. What's your name?
    Lavender T-shirt: Bailey! Like the ice cream. Is this your first time here?
    Player: Yeah, it is. I'm... kind of unsure what to expect?

-> Player; THE GIRL WITH HER HAIR IN A BUN.
    Hair Bun: Hi, I'm Vera. What's your name?
    Player: Hello! I'm Jiayu. Nice to meet you.
    Narrator: Her voice sounds a little low, despite her attempts to make it higher. As though she was dragging out each word.

Narrator: Before you, there are a few boxes of art materials. Colour pencils, paintbrushes, reams of paper and little canvases atop sheets of newspaper spread out to catch any errant spillage.

Narrator: This club is a little... unorthodox. Youâ€™ve heard the reputation. You see one word scrawled across the whiteboard, "LOGO".

Narrator: What could it mean?
