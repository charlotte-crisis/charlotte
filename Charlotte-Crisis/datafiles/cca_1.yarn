You enter the club room for the first time.
The words "self-portrait" are projected onto the screen.
You should probably explore what and who is in the club room first.

There's a few pieces of paper and a box of colour pencils before you.
Before you can ask what you should do with them, a girl you've never seen before enters the room.
New Girl: "Hi! Wait. I don't think I've seen you before..."
You: "Hi, I'm {$name}."
New Girl: "Hello! I'm Eleanor. I kind of keep this club going, I guess."
Eleanor: "Today's theme is quite simple: self-portrait."

-> You: "Isn't that quite hard?"
    Eleanor: "Nah, don't doubt yourself!"
    Eleanor: "We all have to start somewhere."
    Eleanor: "Don't worry about whether your work is good, just get it out there." (+5% confidence) <<changeConfidence(5)>>
    You: "Thank you for that."
    Eleanor: "No problem! We'll share our art in 20 minutes."

    Eleanor: "Awesome! We'll share our art in 20 minutes."
    Eleanor: "Can't wait to see what you'll make!"

-> Male
    <<set $drawing = "Male">>
-> Female
    <<set $drawing = "Female">>

You start drawing. Before you know it, 20 minutes have passed.
