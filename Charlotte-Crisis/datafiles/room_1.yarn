Before you leave, you make sure you have allocated your stats at your desk.
Stats will be used for skill checks in the game.

<<set $name = getName()>>

You have {$int} Intelligence (INT), {$cha} Charisma (CHA), and {$emp} Empathy (EMP).

Do you wish to continue?

In this game, you can allocate stats to Intelligence (INT), Charisma (CHA), and Empathy (EMP).
Sometimes in dialogue, you will have to select options.
Some dialogue outcomes are based on skill checks, whereby your success depends on your stats and a dice roll.
You can allocate an additional stat each time you level up, which is each time you hit 50 Experience Points (XP).
Use the arrow keys to navigate the stat menu.
// Maybe have some splash art?

It's the first day of the semester. You'd just moved into your school's hostel yesterday. (Spacebar to continue)
It was a lot of stuff to move from home, but you're glad your belongings are safe here with you.
And with that, your first class is today. You didn't waste much time (of which you had precious little to begin with) unpacking last night.
TUTORIAL: Left and Right arrow keys to move. Press the up arrow near an object or person to interact.
