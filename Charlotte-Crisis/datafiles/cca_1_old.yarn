You walk into the classroom. The chairs and tables, previously arranged in neat little rows, are haphazardly arranged into a circle. 
There are some people sitting apart from each other. Who do you sit next to?

<<declare $deskmate = "">>
-> THE GUY IN THE SPORTS SINGLET.
    SPORTS: Hey, what's up, bro.
    YOU: Hello! I'm Jiayu. What's your name?
    SPORTS: I'm Anthony.
    INNER_MONOLOGUE: How is this guy not freezing to death in his tight singlet? Not even a shirt, let alone a jacket.
    <<set $deskmate to "anthony">>

-> THE PERSON IN THE BLACK HOODIE.
    Black Hoodie: Hi...?
    YOU: Hello! I'm Jiayu. What's your name?
    Black Hoodie: Sage.
    You get the feeling Sage doesn't quite want to talk to you.
    <<set $deskmate to "sage">>

-> THE GIRL IN THE LAVENDER T-SHIRT.
    Lavender T-shirt: Hi!
    YOU: Hello! I'm Jiayu. What's your name?
    Lavender T-shirt: Bailey! Like the ice cream. Is this your first time here?
    YOU: Yeah, it is. I'm... kind of unsure what to expect?
    <<set $deskmate to "bailey">>

-> THE GIRL WITH HER HAIR IN A BUN.
    Hair Bun: Hi, I'm Vera. What's your name?
    YOU: Hello! I'm Jiayu. Nice to meet you.
    Her voice sounds a little low, despite her attempts to make it higher. As though she was dragging out each word.
    <<set $deskmate to "vera">>

Before you, there are a few boxes of art materials. Colour pencils, paintbrushes, reams of paper and little canvases atop sheets of newspaper spread out to catch any errant spillage.
This club is a little... unorthodox. You've heard the reputation. You see one word scrawled across the whiteboard, "LOGO".
What could it mean?
Eleanor: Okay, everyone! Welcome to our first session of the year!

You recognise her as the President of the Art Club. Her face is on the notice board outside.
Eleanor: Today our prompt is, LOGO. How do you represent yourself through art?

<<if $deskmate == "anthony">>
    Anthony folds his arms and looks deep in thought.
    Eleanor: Maybe find something significant to you. Or just go wild and express your creativity!
<<elseif $deskmate == "sage">>
    Sage scoffs.
    Sage: Not in 2 hours.
<<elseif $deskmate == "bailey">>
    Bailey is already Googling images.
    Glancing over at her phone, you see black bottles.
<<elseif $deskmate == "vera">>
    Vera is deep in thought.

Eleanor: Maybe find something significant to you. Or just go wild and express your creativity!

Narrator; You grab a sheet of paper. What will you draw?
<<declare $logo = "">>
-> Duality.
    Deep down, you know what this means to you.
    The pink and blue form a harmonious circle, with the "add-ons" flaring out to the sides.
    <<set $logo = "duality">>

-> A strong sense of purpose.
    You've seen a million logos like this, real and fictional alike.
    Can't go wrong with swords crossing a shield. Badass! But also grand.
    <<set $logo = "purpose">>

-> Peace.
    What everyone aspires to.
    And for you, that means greenery with splashes of yellow flowers, for some reason.
    <<set $logo = "peace">>

-> Fun.
    Oh yeah! Let’s get crazy.
    You can’t even describe what you’ve put to paper. A modern art masterpiece.
    <<set $logo = "fun">>
<<endif>>

// VERA + DUALITY
VERA: That logo... Is that what I think it is?
YOU: ...what do you mean?
VERA: It's Very Gender.
INNER_MONOLOGUE: Why did she just emphasise those two words?
Vera: So. Tell me about it. What's the logo mean?

-> YOU: It's nothing.  //2
    Vera raises an eyebrow.
    VERA: Oh really?
    You're under a microscope, and she's scrutinising you.
    You're being X-rayed by her; she's seeing right through your facade.
    But you don't really feel this is the time to explain.
    YOU: Yes...
    VERA lowers her eyebrow, and smiles. She's not convinced, but is content to leave you be for now.
    VERA: Alright then, keep your secrets.
    VERA: Wanna see my logo?
    <<jump vera_duality_end>>

-> YOU: Well, I don't know how you'll take this but... I'm a crossdresser. //3
    To your surprise, she smiles and nods.
    VERA: I thought as much. The pink and the blue, the mix of male and female symbols...
    VERA: Clearly, it’s super important to you.
    You nod.
    VERA: Okay, what should I call you then?

-> YOU: Why not take a guess at it?
    VERA smirks. She looks amused.
    VERA: Well, if I were to guess, you're making a statement on gender.
    VERA: Maybe... that you are both male and female, somehow?
    YOU: Bingo.
    VERA: Very interesting. Looks like there's more of us out there than we realise. So, how should I really address you?

// 15 and 16
Eleanor: Hey guys, have y'all showed each other your logos yet?
Vera: Oh, yes! I need to show you my logo.
VERA unfolds her paper.
YOU: You had to fold your paper for this?
VERA: There's more.
Glitter falls off the paper, glistening under the lights.
VERA: Okay, maybe a bit too much, but, y'know, art, right?
Her design is nothing short of psychedelic. The folds helped to imprint colour symmetrically across the whole paper.
And in the middle of it all, a familiar symbol...
VERA: That's on yours, too.
YOU: Yeah, maybe it's kind of obvious.
VERA: Well, sometimes being female is the most important thing we have.
She gets up from her chair.
VERA: Even if some of us have to be incognito to do it.

ZHAN HONG: This shit's over. Looping back to the start.

// 5 or 13
-> YOU: Call me Jiayu.
    VERA: Hmm, okay. Looks like you’re okay with your… birth name, I’m guessing?
    VERA: It's a nice name, by the way. I would have had difficulty guessing the gender from it.
    YOU: Oh yeah. I get misgendered occasionally. You know, people using 'she' with my name.
    VERA: Hmm? And how does that make you feel?

    -> YOU: Annoyed. //6
        VERA: Oh? Why?
        YOU: Like, I guess there's this side of me. But it's not like I want to be called by a female name while being male, right?
        VERA: Fair enough, no one likes to be called a name they don't identify with. Still, I'm curious...
        YOU: Yeah?
        VERA: You keep your male and female personas strictly separate?
            //at this point might be good to split it up into different nodes.
            -> YOU: “Is this another ‘how does this make you feel’ question?” //7
                VERA: "I'm sorry if I'm going too far. I just think it's interesting."
                Before you can ask why, ELEANOR pops out from around the corner.
                <<jump vera_duality_end>>
            
            -> YOU: “Yes, it’s easier that way.” //8
                VERA: "I see. Well, I can relate."
                YOU: "Are you saying...?"
                VERA: "Isn't it obvious?"
                You're not sure if it is. 
                But before you've got time to consider it further, Eleanor pops out from around the corner.
                <<jump vera_duality_end>>

    -> YOU: Empowered. //9
        VERA puts her hand on her chest.
        VERA: Yass slay queen.
        YOU: Yeah, even though I'm not presenting as female now...
        VERA: That's okay. You are female if you want to be.

        -> YOU: But doesn't that go against, like, basic biology? // 10
            VERA: Well, being female isn't basic biology, it's... 
            You can tell VERA wants to elaborate, but she decides against it.
            Maybe she has a lot to say?
            VERA: ... you know what, let's just say none of this is basic. Especially not the biology.
            VERA: I simply believe that people should be who they're allowed to be.
            Before you've got time to internalise that, ELEANOR comes around the corner. 
            <<jump vera_duality_end>>

        -> YOU: Yass slay queen. // 11
            VERA: That felt good to say, didn’t it?
            YOU: Yeah! I bet you say it so often.
            VERA: Well, I do have my moments, but, still... life gets tough.
            VERA: Some moments are decidedly not yass slay queen.
            VERA: So like... naur unslay king? You know, the direct opposite.
            YOU: Oh dear. Is everything... alright?
            Before Vera can answer, ELEANOR comes around the corner.
            <<jump vera_duality_end>>
    
    -> YOU: I just think it’s funny. // 12
        VERA: Oh yass, assigned female at school or work or wherever. Just not at birth.
        YOU: And you would know?
        VERA: Maybe.
        Could she be...
        VERA: But yeah, I'm glad that you're taking it in stride.
        YOU: You seem to be quite well-versed in these issues.
        VERA: Let's just say I know what it feels like.
        <<jump vera_duality_reveal>>

-> YOU: Call me Charlotte.
    VERA: Charlotte! That's a pretty name. I love how it rolls off the tongue.
    YOU: Thank you! But, uh… Don’t you think I'm weird for calling myself a female name in male form?
    VERA: You're Charlotte whenever you want to be.
    YOU: Uh… thanks!
    VERA: You don't usually hear that, do you?
    YOU: Nope.
    VERA: All the more we have to stand up for each other.

YOU: You're a crossdresser too?
VERA: Well... used to be.
YOU: Oh… so you used to wear… like, guy clothes?
VERA smirks to herself.
VERA: In a way, yes. But that was a long time ago.
YOU: Then... you stopped?
VERA: Yes.
YOU: That’s kinda sad. Why, though?
VERA: Because I found I could be much happier without them.
YOU: Now you’re just making me more confused.
VERA: Is it really so hard to tell?
YOU: Well, yes! You look totally femme now.
VERA: Thank you. Then, I’ll spare you the confusion. I’m trans.
YOU are too stunned to speak.
VERA: A secret for a secret, okay?
YOU simply nod. This was a lot to take in.
VERA: You really are stunned, are you?
YOU: Yeah... it reminds me of my first time seeing a trans person.
VERA looks like she's going to ask about it, but ELEANOR steps in.
