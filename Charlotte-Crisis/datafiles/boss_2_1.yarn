//// Commented out the stuff that dont sit right with walking up
// You walk into the cafe. Looking around for Helen...
Helen: "Hi, are you Charlotte?"
You: "Yep."
Helen: "Ah, okay. I'm Helen. Nice to meet you."
<<goto_room_boss_2_1_seated()>>
// Helen "Ah, okay. I'm Helen. Let's get food first?"
// The two of you get your food and return to the table.
Helen: "Why did you reach out to me, anyway?"
You: "You're a crossdresser too. I need advice on some things."
Helen: "Yeah, you told me that over text. I'm just surprised that you would be so... open."
Helen: "You literally Googled 'crossdresser Singapore', saw me in the results, and reached out?"
Helen: "I'm not sure if that's bravery or recklessness."
-> "Times have changed."
    Helen: "Well thanks for reminding me I'm old. But what do you mean?"
    You: "I mean, in an era where you can find your life partner online..."
    <<addExperience(10)>>
    You: "Is it that surprising that I'm finding emotional support online too?" (+10 XP)
    Helen: "I guess not."
    Helen: "Still, if I was someone worse, you'd be in for a bad time."
-> "I mean, you agreed to meet me, too."
    You: "So if you're saying it was unsafe for me to meet you, maybe it goes both ways."
    Helen: "That is... adorable. But that would mean I willingly walked into a trap."
    Helen: "Are you going to prove me wrong for trusting you?"
    Helen: "Anyway..."
-> "I really like reading your blog."
    <<addExperience(10)>>
    Helen: "Thank you! Hope you found it useful." (+10 XP)
    Helen: "Well, maybe not useful enough. After all, here I am explaining things in the flesh."
-> "I want to believe people are accepting."
    Helen: "Girl, please."
    You: "What's wrong with that?"
    Helen: "Nothing. I'm just surprised at how idealistic you are..."
-> "You're right... maybe this was a bad idea."
    <<changeConfidence(-5)>>
    Helen rolls her eyes. (-5% confidence)
    Helen: "Well, we're here already. Might as well make the best of our time."
    Helen: "After all, I don't get to bring Helen out often."

Helen: "Are you very open with expressing Charlotte? It took me a lot of effort to even get to this stage."
You: "Yeah. School is very accepting."
Helen: "School? We're from the same university, right?"
Helen: "How are you so daring? When I was there, I never dared to bring Helen out."
-> "Times have changed."
    Helen: "Haiya. Yet another reminder that I'm old."
-> "I have my own room on campus."
    Helen: "Ah. So did I."
    Helen: "But I never dared to present as Helen outside my dorm room."
    Helen: "I didn't want to know what the others would say about me."
-> "Are you saying I shouldn't bring Charlotte out, then?"
    Helen: "I'm just surprised no one has harassed you yet."
    Helen: "The fact that you're still going strong like this is good. For now."
Helen: "So I guess your friends are all accepting?"
-> "They're the best!" 
    Helen: "Oh, that's good to hear." 
    Helen: "I guess your generation's attitude is really different."
    Helen: "But the outside world isn't gonna be so kind."
-> "Meh, some of them could be better."
    Helen: "There will always be terrible people."
    Helen: "People who comment and criticise, of course."
    Helen: "But even just one stare, at the wrong time, can hurt."

Helen scrolls through your phone.

Helen: "Anyway! So, why did you seek Helen out today?"
You: "I need advice on how I'm going to explain Charlotte to my mother."
Helen: "I assume she hates it, and wants you to stop?"
You: "Yep."
Helen: "Hmm. Based on my experiences, there are a few options available."
Helen: "You can either hide it entirely, come to a compromise, or move out."
Helen: "Which would you like to hear?"
-> "Hide."
    Helen: "That's what I do, for everyone except my wife."
    Helen: "In my line of work, it's too risky for people to know about Helen."
    Helen: "So, I keep my male and Helen social media accounts strictly separate."
    Helen: "And all of Helen's stuff is stuffed in an obscure part of my wife's closet."
    Helen: "That way, if my mum or my kid chance upon it, I can say it's hers."

-> "Compromise."
    Helen: "This one is the hardest one emotionally."
    Helen: "To be honest, I dread this confrontation also, with my own mother."
    Helen: "But I've talked to other crossdressers and trans women who made it."
    Helen: "I think one thing you could do is to ease her into it."
    You: "What do you mean?"
    Helen: "Change your wardrobe. Wear more gender-neutral clothing."
    Helen: "Wear makeup more reminiscent of K-pop male idols, so not the strong stuff we're wearing now."
    <<jump 7_2>>

Helen: "Makes me think you want to be seen as a guy."

        -> "Fine, maybe it's not cruel. But it definitely is restrictive."
            Helen: "Yeah, but it's all worth it when you look in the mirror and see a perfect female face staring back."
            Helen: "So the question is, what are you going to do about it?"

        Helen: "Aren't you scared of getting clocked?"
        You: "More people in society are accepting of gender diversity."

-> "About my body parts, women aren't all dainty and small."

    Helen: "Or when your hands are so much larger and mannish than theirs."
    Helen: "Doesn't that make you feel like you're out of place?"
        -> "Tall women! We stan!"

            You: "But yes, I think there's nothing wrong with being a tall woman!"

            You: "Crouch all the time so she can be 'average female height'?"
            Helen: "I guess not..."
            You: "So we can just be tall women. There's nothing wrong with that."

                You: "And what am I supposed to do about that, other than exist?"

Helen: "Start subtle, then when they're used to your androgynous look you can go to dresses."
