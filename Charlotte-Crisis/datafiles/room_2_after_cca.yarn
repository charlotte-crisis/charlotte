    You just got back!
<<else>>
    You feel like hanging out with a friend this week, for a quick meal.
    Who will you ask out? 
    -> On second thought, nevermind. (Go back)

    -> Stay in today. #continue
        Hmm... you don't seem to be friendly enough with anyone.
        You can stay in today, but please try to understand and befriend people around you...

    Do you want to use your phone in bed?
    -> Yes
        <<addExperience(10)>>
        Alright, a few minutes won't hurt.
        The algorithms feed you videos, memes, and other content till your eyes hurt.
        Let's hope you retained even a bit of that... (+ 10 XP)
    -> No
        <<changeConfidence(5)>>
        Yeah, don't you know using your phone too much is bad for you?
        Get some more sleep! Sleep fixes everything. (+5% confidence)
