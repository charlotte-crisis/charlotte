Chenjie: "Busy, I guess."
Chenjie: "I'll bet every single uni student would say that to be honest."
You: "That's true. Anyone I ask this question to generally starts complaining about workload."
Chenjie: "Yeah, but it scares me a bit to think about the working world though. I do wonder if the workload and stress will increase or decrease."
-> "I think it will increase."
    You: "There are tons more responsibilities as soon as you become an adult. Taxes, bills."
    You: "Not to mention, our work affects people, and not just our grades in the future."
-> "I think it will decrease."
    You: "I think when you become an adult, you start to have more control of your life and what you want to do."
    You: "And I think you'd feel less tied down and restricted. So your life will be less stressful that way."
-> "I think it will stay the same."
    You: "I think all stages of life are stressful and difficult in their own way. So it all balances out in the end."
Chenjie: "Yeah, maybe you're right..."
Chenjie: "But what about you? How is school treating you?"

    Chenjie: "The debates we have in class are very fulfilling and thought-provoking."
-> "It's been awful."
    You: "Do you think it's too late to drop out?"
    Chenjie: "Is it that bad?"
    Chenjie: "Hey... If you need emotional help or something... You can always talk to me..."
    Chenjie: "Or maybe if it's really bad, you might want to consider seeing a counsellor or something."
    Chenjie: "Our school has some pretty good counsellors. I can tell you the name of my counsellor, and you could talk to him."
    You: "You had counselling before?"
    Chenjie: "Yeah, had a bad breakup previously and I needed some help for that."
    -> "Was it helpful?"
        Chenjie: "Very! I sorted through a lot of unhelpful beliefs."
        Chenjie: "And there's something nice about someone who has to listen to all your troubles." 
        You: "That's good."

        Chenjie: "There's no harm trying if you ever want to talk to someone."
-> "It's tough but I'll manage."
    Chenjie: "That's good. It's the final year. We'll get through this!"

Chenjie: "I've been learning to cook local dishes like chicken rice, laksa, beef hor fun... All my favourites."
Chenjie: "So that when I'm overseas, I'll be able to whip up something for myself if I crave Singaporean food."

Chenjie: "After graduation, I'll get a good momentum going, and the first place I want to go to is Switzerland!"
-> "Why Switzerland first?"
    Chenjie smiles shyly.
    Chenjie: "Actually, it's because it's my mom's dream vacation spot. So I want to go there with her before setting off on my digital nomad journey."
    Chenjie: "She said she watched a cartoon as a kid about the Swiss Alps so she'd always dreamed of going there."
    You: "That's so sweet of you."

    It's not something trivial though.

    Should you bring up how much it hurt you?

        You: "It's not just a really small part to me though."

The two of you continue to chat for a bit longer.
But soon, it is time to leave.
Chenjie: "Hey, good talk, yeah?"
Chenjie: "I hope what I said helps you with your family."
Chenjie: "It is really quite sad when people are unaccepting of people who are different from them."
Chenjie: "So I hope things go well for you in the end."
-> "Thank you."
-> "I hope so too."
-> "It's going to be hard."
[i]Chenjie gives you a reassuring pat.[/i] 
Chenjie: "You've got this, alright, {$name}?"
[i]On that warm note, he leaves.[/i]
