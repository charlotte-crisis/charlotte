Prof Lim: "Settle down, everyone!"
Prof Lim: "Okay, today, the topic will be on Gender in Beauty."
Prof Lim: "First, we shall start with a short video."

Prof starts a clip of a South Korean game show, and it quickly becomes clear what the game show is about.
Women getting plastic surgery makeovers, showcased in dramatic before-and-after photos and an energetic upbeat catwalk.
All the women are confident and happy on the runway while the crowds and judges are wow-ed by the transformation.
The video ends.

Prof Lim: "Right, we shall start with discussion questions."
Prof Lim: "First, do you think plastic surgery made the women in this show more beautiful?"
Prof Lim: "Next, who determines what beauty is?"
Prof Lim: "How does the concept of beauty affect people's lives?"
Prof Lim: "Gather in your groups and discuss this."

<<goto_room_class_1_discussion()>>
Chenjie: "Okay, so... what do you think about the women after plastic surgeries, right?"
Chenjie: "If they became prettier."
There is a slightly uncomfortable silence, like no one wants to be the first to answer.

-> "Um, they indeed became prettier."
    You: "We don't like hearing it but... plastic surgeries do in fact make people more beautiful."
    <<changeRelationship("J", 5)>>
    Joanne: "Yeah... I mean, they did the surgery in the first place, right?" (+5% Joanne relationship)
    Joanne: "The transformations were all quite drastic. They didn't even look like the same person anymore."
    Chenjie: "I think they were also pretty in their own way before and after."
    Sage: "Yeah, but you usually only say 'in their own way' when one of them is a clear winner."
    Chenjie winces.
    Chenjie: "I guess so... It's really not nice to say though."
    Joanne: "It's reality though. Women are judged against a certain beauty standard."

Chenjie: "But what does beauty even mean?"
Joanne: "It's like ticking boxes on a checklist to say whether people are attractive or not."
Chenjie: "Yeah... And it sounds so arbitrary."
Chenjie: "They say that people with features that follow the golden ratio are beautiful."
Sage: "And facial symmetry."
Joanne: "Yeah. Another one is having healthy-looking hair."

-> "Having fair and smooth skin."

    Chenjie: "It's honestly sad that it affects even kids and their self-perception... It's evil."

    Sage: "To an extent, I guess? But it's not that important, is it?"

Sage: "You have to admit that after the surgery, they became more conventionally beautiful."
Sage: "As much as we try to sugarcoat things."
Joanne: "Yeah, this show is sort of building on pre-existing societal expectations."
Joanne: "It's not like it invented the beauty standards by itself. There's a reason why they did plastic surgery."

-> "Yeah, it's just not really nice to say they're not beautiful..."
    Sage: "I get it, it's quite mean to say out loud..."
    Sage: "I agree, it makes you feel quite awful making these judgements about others' appearances." 
    Chenjie: "Yeah... Like, who are we to say if someone is beautiful or not?"

Sage: "Women are more likely to be criticised for their appearances."
You: "Yeah, there are tons of criteria women usually have to meet beforeâ€”"
Joanne: "God, I've had enough!"
Joanne: "Look, are we just going to straight up ignore the fact that you are a complete affront to womanhood?"
You: "What...?"
Joanne: "Us girls get made fun of for not looking girly enough, or looking too girly, or being too fat or not curvy enough."
Joanne: "And you get to just dress up and pretend to be a girl for fun?"

-> "I know women face a lot of unfair criticism and scrutiny for their appearance."
    You: "We need to stop forcing unrealistic beauty standards on women, and learn to accept the diversity in women."

Sage: "Like, it's weird that the guys who are the most adamant that no makeup is the best are also the ones who are only nice to pretty looking girls."
Sage: "And somehow, us girls have to achieve that no makeup look while putting on makeup."
