Nadia: "Oh yes, absolutely. I stay so far from school!"
Nadia: "I'm cramming all my lessons into just 3 days to minimise travel time, you know?"
Nadia: "And besides, I'm still in year 2. There's still time."

-> "So what's stopping you?"
    Nadia: "Can't get a room… It's super competitive."
    Nadia: "And, to be honest, I dread having to move so many things."
    Nadia: "So many heavy suitcases…"
    
-> "You should go for it."
    Nadia: "It's not that easy…"
    Nadia: "I need to be super involved in the hall activities, right?"
    Nadia: "and it's super expensive…"
    Nadia: "Whatever. I'll think about it later."

Nadia: "Anyway! What about you? You're still staying on campus, right?"
You: "Yep. Been here 4 years."
Nadia: "What's the best part about staying?"

-> "There isn't really one."
    Nadia: "Really?"
    You: "Well, not anything that comes to mind."
    Nadia: "Oh… then why did you stay all 4 years?"
    You: "I don't know… felt consistent, I guess."
    Nadia: "Okay…"

-> "The privacy."
    You: "Even before Charlotte, I appreciated being away from my family."
    You: "There was one weekend where I really needed to finish a project…"
    You: "I just sat in my room and kept going at it until it was done."
    You: "I swear, time flows differently when you don't have distractions."
    You: "And when I discovered Charlotte, I also discovered I needed a space to be Charlotte…"
    You: "So my room's the perfect place."
    Nadia: "Ah, I see… I'm sorry to hear about your family."
    Nadia: "But yes! Sounds like you're really enjoying yourself."

    -> "Would you enjoy time away from family, though?"
        You: "You seem pretty close to them."

Nadia: "Accountancy… well, it's stable enough, I guess."
Nadia: "Sometimes there's a whole lot of studying."
Nadia: "You would not believe how many tax regulations I need to read weekly."
Nadia: "Still, at least I'm not in the more cutthroat courses."

-> "Do you enjoy it?"
    Nadia: "Enjoy? I don't really enjoy studying."
    Nadia: "It's just kinda easy enough for me to do…"
    Nadia: "And a source of employment."

-> "What do you mean cutthroat?"
    Nadia: "Those modules which take note of everything you do…"
    Nadia: "Even your day-to-day appearance, not to mention your presentation attire…"
    Nadia: "Don't even get me started on the people."
    Nadia: "Like, it's not in the grading and all, but you can feel the pressure there."

Nadia: "What about your major?"

-> "Nothing remarkable about it."
    You: "I'm just a communications student."
    Nadia: "Uh… I guess you can communicate better then?"
    You: "Perhaps. But I don't see it."
    You: "At the end of the day, it's just a degree."
    Nadia: "I guess so…"

-> "Kind of a waste of time, honestly."
    You: "Maybe I should have studied something more employable."
    Nadia: "Eh? I thought communications should have quite a lot of jobs?"
    You: "None that I'm interested in."
    Nadia: "Hmm… well, hope you still found something useful."
    You: "If not, those school fees are all going down the drain, right?"

-> "It's great! I can study what I want."
    You: "There's a whole gender studies module within it."
    You: "I'm definitely going to tap on my experiences as Charlotte to do well."
    Nadia: "Oh slay! It's like the module was custom-made for you."

        Nadia: "They always talk about earning big la, 'hustle culture' la..."
        Nadia: "They'd fit right into business school, if they weren't already there."
        Nadia: "It's worse when they speak in their own jargon."

            You: "But still I persist in being Charlotte."
            You: "So if that's what you wanna aim for in your own CCA..."
            You: "Then own it, and I hope you really thrive there."
            Nadia: "Thanks for all that!"

    -> "Romance...?"
        Nadia: "Ahh yes, my favourite!"
        Nadia: "Hmm... I don't really like telling people this, but..."
        Nadia: "I like the BL stuff."
        You: "Ah, so is that the stuff you're drawing in Art Club?"
        Nadia: "No! I promise, no."
        Nadia: "I wouldn't want the world to see the BL that I draw."

        -> "Yes, because it's kinda weird."
            Nadia: "No, it's not hentai!"
            Nadia: "Uh... okay, I'm probably digging myself deeper, right?"
            You: "Yeah. Why do you like to see boys kissing?"
            Nadia: "What's wrong with that?"

            -> "It just weirds me out."
                Nadia: "Well then it's you say, I say, isn't it?"
                Nadia: "Just let a girl have her own hobbies, okay?"
                Nadia: "And I thought Charlotte would understand that." (-5% Nadia relationship) <<changeRelationship("N", -5)>>
                
            -> "It's so risque."
                Nadia: "Where got? It's not NSFW. No naughty bits on display."
                Nadia: "Well then I guess we can't have fanservice either."
                Nadia: "Are you so conservative that you can't accept PDA?"
        
        -> "What's wrong with that?"
            Nadia: "I don't know! But people don't like it."
            You: "Is it just homophobia?"
            Nadia: "Not really also! I know people who are supportive but they still don't like it."

            -> "Regardless, it sucks that you gotta hide your preferences."
                You: "I mean, I'd know what that feels like. Charlotte would."
                Nadia: "Yeah, it's not like I'm hurting anyone with it..."
        
            -> "Haters gonna hate."
                You: "There's always gonna be people taking issue with what you do, what you like."
                Nadia: "So why care, right?"
                You: "Exactly. And it's not like BL is new..."
                You: "It wouldn't even be the first time gay people are depicted in media."
                Nadia: "Yes! Just let people be happy."
            
            Nadia: "I'm glad I have your support on this... others kinda just think I'm weird."
            You: "Can't be weirder than me."
            Nadia: "Don't say that! But yeah, thank you." (+5% Nadia relationship) <<changeRelationship("N", 5)>>
            
    -> "Give me something unconventional."
        Nadia: "Ooh, interesting."
        Nadia: "Well, there's one which I watched recently about talking animals."
        Nadia: "But it's not kiddy! It's super mature."
        Nadia: "The protagonist is a taxi-driving walrus and he's involved in some disappearance case."
        Nadia: "Everyone's super complex in that series and the ending really wraps up all the plot threads nicely."
        Nadia: "Okay... uh... that was quite long. Sorry."
        Nadia: "I don't usually monologue like that but it's so good!!"

-> "I don't get the appeal, honestly."
    Nadia: "Uh... okay..."
    Nadia: "I mean, to each their own. I like to watch stuff that makes me happy."
    Nadia: "You know, taking the stress out of life."

    -> "But, of all things, anime..."
        Nadia: "Well it's just a medium."
        Nadia: "There's as many types of anime as there are films..."
        Nadia: "And you don't see people criticising movies for being childish or degenerate or whatever."

        -> "You have a point."
            Nadia: "Go try out some anime. You may like it."
        
        -> "Nope, still cringe."
            Nadia: "I guess we shouldn't talk about this." (-5% Nadia relationship) <<changeRelationship("N", 5)>>
        
    -> "I just don't like the fans."
        Nadia: "I know what you're talking about."
        Nadia: "Those guys who are obsessed with just one character or series..."
        Nadia: "And they shove it in everyone's faces."
        Nadia: "But we aren't all like that!"

        -> "You're like that."
            Nadia: "Really? I don't think so..."
            You: "Oh yeah? What else have you drawn at CCA aside from anime?"
            Nadia: "Uh..."
            You: "Doesn't that count as pushing anime on all of us?"
            Nadia sighs. (-5% Nadia relationship) <<changeRelationship("N", -5)>>
        
        -> "Yeah, you're right."
            Nadia: "We aren't all degens."
            Nadia: "I thought you'd understand that..."
            Nadia: "Understand what it feels like to be the odd one out."
        
    -> "Yes, to each our own."
        You: "I'm glad you found your happy place in anime."
        Nadia: "We all deserve our own happy places."
        Nadia: "I mean, your crossdressing is a happy place of its own, isn't it?"

    Nadia: "Honestly... I'm not sure..."
    Nadia: "He's so annoying but I don't dare to say that to his face."

-> "What do you think of Vera?"

    Nadia: "Sometimes, a little too smart. But that's not really a bad thing!"

    Nadia: "Uh... okay. I'll try to help. What's up at home?"
    You: "My mother hates Charlotte. I think I'll have to confront her about this soon."
    Nadia: "Oh dear... that does sound really tough."
    Nadia: "Well, why do you want to do it in the first place?"

    -> "Actually, maybe not."
        Nadia: "Well that was quick."
        You: "I'm just wondering if confronting her is worth it."
        Nadia: "What do you mean?"
        You: "If I confront her, that's gonna be a lot of emotional damage."
        You: "And I'm okay with hiding Charlotte."
        Nadia: "How are you gonna do that, though?"

        -> "I'll hide her outside the house."
            Nadia: "You mean, only dress up outside the house?"
            You: "Yep."
            Nadia: "Isn't that gonna be really hard, though?"
            Nadia: "All your girl stuff needs to fit into one bag."

        -> "I'll suppress her."
            Nadia: "Oh no... that's kind of like throwing away a part of yourself, isn't it?"
            Nadia: "It's like if you asked me to stop liking anime!"

            -> "I'm always Charlotte."
                Nadia: "What do you mean?"
                You: "I'm Charlotte when I tell myself I am."
                You: "You can throw away my dresses and makeup, but I'll still have that feminine essence in me."
                Nadia: "Woah. Is that a rehearsal for your mom?"
                Nadia: "It sounds super strong."

        -> "I just won't transition."
            Nadia: "Yeah, I guess that's a reasonable starting point."

            Nadia: "A lot worse, don't you think?"
            Nadia: "Seeing your pictures is just the tip of the iceberg."

        Nadia: "I mean, we're in Gen Z."
        Nadia: "We're supposed to be more tolerant and all that, right?"
        Nadia: "And even for those who don't like it... it's your life, not theirs."

        Nadia: "Just let Charlotte be her own woman, I guess."
