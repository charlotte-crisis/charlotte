- It might be good to come up with a scene flow diagram. Helps to demarcate which is the scene to start at, and which scenes are connected to which ones.
I forgot the term, which was covered in NM3216. haha!

-- In fact, any good practices (documentation or whatever) that might serve us well that were taught in NM3216 might be good to apply here. Although I may have forgotten some of what we've learned.

- Move stats into the PlayerStats script/game object. The stats should now be accessed and handled from this single object.

- Consider the need for jumping in this game.

- TODO: Instructions (for testers - maybe put in Document)

- TODO: for zhan hong: Look into how Story inkStory object works.
